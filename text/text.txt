we had books called face books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. at first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking.

robert metzler, the shows business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the adlib it appeared to be.the th academy awards, held in , presented the first academy award for best animated feature.from  to  and since , all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture. for , this tradition was broken as the ceremony ended with the academy award for best actor.

traditionally, the previous years winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress, while the previous years winner for best actress and best supporting actress presents the awards for best actor and best supporting actor.

on february , , parasite became the first foreignlanguage film to win best picture at the award ceremony of nd academy awards.tom hanks announced, at the  oscar ceremony, the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures on december , . the museum development started in  under kerry brougher, but is now led by bill kramer. the industrycurated exhibits are geared toward the history of motion pictures and the art  science of film making, exhibiting trailblazing directors, actors, filmmakers, sound editors and more, and the museum houses famous artifacts from acclaimed movies such as dorothys ruby red slippers from the wizard of oz.

the rd academy awards ceremony, honoring the best films of  and early , was held on april , , after it was postponed from its original february , , schedule due to the impact of the covid pandemic on cinema. as with the two previous ceremonies, there was no host. the ceremony was broadcast on abc. it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles, california for the th consecutive year, along with satellite location taking place at the union station also in los angeles. because of the virus impact on films and tv industries, academy president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson announced that for the  oscar ceremony, streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible. the theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the th academy awards.

the best known award is the academy award of merit, more popularly known as the oscar statuette. made of goldplated bronze on a black metal base, it is . in  tall, weighs . lb , and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors, writers, directors, producers, and technicians.

sculptor george stanley  sculpted cedric gibbons design. the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were goldplated solid bronze. within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal, a pewterlike alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, karat gold. due to a metal shortage during world war ii, oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. following the war, the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for goldplated metal ones. the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. the original oscar mold was cast in  at the c.w. shumway  sons foundry in batavia, illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes. from  to , approximately  oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer r.s. owens  company. it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture  statuettes. in , the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to walden, new yorkbased polich tallix fine art foundry, now owned and operated by uap urban art projects. while based on a digital scan of an original  oscar, the statuettes retain their modernera dimensions and black pedestal. cast in liquid bronze from dprinted ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in karat gold by brooklyn, new yorkbased epner technology. the time required to produce  such statuettes is roughly three months. r.s. owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating.

the origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy oscar.

bette davis, in her  autobiography, claimed she named it in  after her first husband, harmon oscar nelson, of whom the statues rear end reminded her. but the term had been in use at least two years before, and in a  biography written by whitney stine with commentary from davis, davis wrote i relinquish once and for all any claim that i was the one  so, academy of motion picture arts and sciences, the honor is all yours.margaret herrick, librarian and president of the academy, may have said she named it after her supposed uncle oscar in . the only corroboration was a  clipping from the los angeles examiner, in which herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase, hows your uncle oscar.columnist sidney skolsky wrote in his  memoir that he came up with the term in  under pressure for a deadline, mocking vaudeville comedians who asked will you have a cigar, oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march , , which was written about that years th academy awards. but in the newspaper clipping that skolsky referred to, he wrote that these statues are called oscars, meaning that the name was already in use.bruce davis, a former executive director of the academy, credits eleanore lilleberg, a secretary at the academy when the award was first introduced, for the nickname, as she had been in charge of preceremony handling of the awards. davis credits lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of einar lilleberg, eleanores brother, that einar had referenced a norwegian army veteran named oscar that the two knew in chicago, whom einar described as having always stood straight and tall. he asserts credit should almost certainly belong to lilleberg.

to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. until , winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars. since , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscriptionprocessing station at the governors ball, a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony. the r.s. owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. the nameplates for the nonwinning nominees are later recycled.

prior to , oscar statuettes were  the property of the recipient. since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us. if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the academy keeps the statuette. academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sixfigure sums.in , michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his  production of around the world in  days to a movie prop collector. the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

in , harold russell consigned his  oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses. though his decision caused controversy, the first oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on august ,  for , . russell defended his action, saying, i dont know why anybody would be critical. my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons. the movie will be here, even if oscar isnt.in december , orson welles  oscar for citizen kane  was put up for auction, after his heirs won a  court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy. on december , , it sold in an online auction for us, .some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy, which keeps them in its treasury.

in addition to the academy award of merit , there are nine honorary  awards presented by the academy from time to time

the academy honorary award  ;

the irving g. thalberg memorial award  ;

the jean hersholt humanitarian award  ;

the academy scientific and technical awards

the gordon e. sawyer award ; and

the academy student academy awards .the academy also awards nicholl fellowships in screenwriting.

from  to , the academy award nomination results were announced to the public in midjanuary. prior to that, the results were announced in early february. in , the nominees were announced in march. in , the nominees were announced in early february for the first time since .

the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over , as of .academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering , members  of the academys composition. votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers  since the th academy awards in . the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the academy in december to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in january of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors, on behalf of academy branch executive committees. membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

new membership proposals are considered annually. the academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as  press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. the  release also stated that it has just under , voting members. while the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.in , the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately  of ampas voting membership. of the , active voters confirmed,  were caucasian,  were male, and  were found to be over the age of .  of voting members are former nominees  and winners .in may , the academy sent a letter advising its , or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in .

according to rules  and  of the official academy awards rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of january  to midnight at the end of december , in los angeles county, california, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify . additionally, the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between  pm and  pm local time.for example, the  best picture winner, the hurt locker, was originally first released in , but did not qualify for the  awards, as it did not play its oscarqualifying run in los angeles until mid, thus qualifying for the  awards. foreign films must include english subtitles, and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year.rule  states that a film must be featurelength, defined as a minimum of  minutes, except for shortsubject awards, and it must exist either on a  mm or  mm film print or in  frame/s or  frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of  by  pixels. since the th academy awards, presented in , multipart and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award. this followed the win of o.j. made in america, an eighthour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn, in that category in . the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.the best international feature film award does not require a u.s. release. it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection.

the best documentary feature award requires either weeklong releases in both los angeles county and any of the five boroughs of new york city during the previous calendar year, or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list , or submission in the international feature film category as its countrys official selection. the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for nondocumentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. additionally, a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times, time out new york, the los angeles times, or la weekly.producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year. the form includes the production credits for all related categories. then, each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases.

awards in short film categories  have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. first, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering one year starting on october , and ending on september  of the calendar year before the ceremony. second, there are multiple methods of qualification. the main method is a weeklong theatrical release in either new york city or los angeles county during the eligibility period. films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible . the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. only one screening per day is required. for the documentary award, the screening must start between noon and  pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.

in late december, ballots, and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around , active members. for most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories . in the special case of best picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. in all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees  ranked preferentially. in certain categories, including international feature film, documentary and animated feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

in most categories, the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members. since , the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting. since , reweighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects.film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season. the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders. for example, a producer of the  best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the frontrunner .

the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films  in one place. it was introduced in , for the  oscars, though dvd screeners and academy inperson screenings were still provided. for films to be included on the platform, the north american distributor must pay ,, including a watermarking fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy. the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players. the watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.in , for the  oscars, the academy banned all physical screeners and inperson screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room. films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform. distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform. the inperson screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid pandemic. eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are.

the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. it is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during november or december of the previous year. this is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bowtie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this .

the academy awards is the worlds longestrunning awards show televised live from the u.s. to all time zones in north america and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. the oscars were first televised in  by nbc, which continued to broadcast the event until , when abc took over, televising the festivities  through . nbc regained the rights for five years , then abc resumed broadcast duties in  and its current contract with the academy runs through . the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets  in more desirable local timeslots. the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since , but only two south american countries, chile and brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. by that time, the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in  countries. a decade later, the rights were already being sold to  countries, and by , the tv rights to the awards were licensed in  countries.

the ceremonies were moved up from late march/early april to late february, since , to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry. another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament, which would cut into the academy awards audience.  the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period. some years, the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games. another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history, with  wins and  nominations overall since that awards own launch in .after many years of being held on mondays at  pm eastern/ p.m pacific, since the  ceremonies, it was moved to sundays at  pm et/ pm pt. the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays, that los angeles rushhour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier. for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. in , the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january, citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season. however, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers . furthermore, a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games. in , the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nd academy awards in .originally scheduled for april , , the th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of dr. martin luther king, jr. on march , , the rd academy awards was postponed for one day, after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington, d.c.in , an in memoriam segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding  months, a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members. this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. this segment was later followed by a commercial break.

in terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. the first oscars, in , lasted  minutes. at the other end of the spectrum, the  ceremony lasted four hours and twentythree minutes. in , the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past  seconds. this, according to organizer bill mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show  overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion. in , in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners dedications were displayed on an onscreen ticker. during the  ceremony, host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become, by announcing that he would give a brandnew jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night . the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the  telecasts as follows  on song performances;  on the hosts speeches;  on prerecorded clips; and  on the awards themselves, broken into  on the introduction and announcement,  on winners walking to the stage, and  on their acceptance speeches.although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped; the th academy awards were the lowestrated in the past eight years , while the show itself also faced mixed reception. following the show, variety reported that abc was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. currently and nominally, ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions. in august , ampas extended its contract with abc through  the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast.

historically, the telecasts viewership is higher when boxoffice hits are favored to win the best picture award. more than . million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th academy awards in , the year of titanic, which generated a box office haul during its initial  run of us. million in the us, a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years. the th academy awards ceremony, in which the lord of the rings the return of the king  received  awards including best picture, drew . million viewers. the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date, however, was the nd academy awards  which drew a . household rating on april , . hoping to reinvigorate the preshow and ratings, the  oscars organizers hired members of the met gala creative teamby contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critical acclaim those films have received. the th academy awards which awarded lowbudget independent film crash  generated an audience of . million with a household rating of .. in , the th academy awards telecast was watched by . million viewers on average with an . household rating, the lowestrated and leastwatched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating  years of the academy awards. the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film .

whereas the nd academy awards drew an average of . million viewers, the rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of . million, the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in . the th and th editions drew . and . million viewers, still below the audience of the nd edition.

the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the  oscars and material on many prior ceremonies, along with ancillary material related to more recent shows. copies are held in a variety of film, video and digital formats.

in , the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel. from  to , the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles.

graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from  to , followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from  to . the st academy awards in  were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood.from  to , the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre. with the advent of television, the awards from  to  took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york, first at the nbc international theatre  and then at the nbc century theatre, after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles. the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica, california, in . by , the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles, this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center. in the late s and early s, the ceremony returned to the shrine auditorium.

in , hollywoods dolby theatre  became the presentations current venue.

in the first year of the awards, the best directing award was split into two categories . at times, the best original score award has also been split into separate categories . from the s through the s, the art direction , cinematography, and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories . prior to , the production design award was called art direction, while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup.

in august , the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.

following dissent from academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all  categories live. this followed several proposals  that the academy had announced but did not implement.

the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories. to date, the following categories have been proposed

due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards, many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season. this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality. william friedkin, an academy awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in , describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself.tim dirks, editor of amcs filmsite.org, has written of the academy awards

unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. especially since the s, moneymaking formulamade blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowdpleasing titans , but they havent necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign. these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history.

typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an overrepresentation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the u.s. in the last three months of the calendar year. the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies. this has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.

the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees. this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since , which show that only . of academy award nominees have been nonwhite and since , . of nominees have been nonwhite, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing. due to a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of highprofile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals, as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters. it took until  for an asian woman to win an academy award for best actress, when michelle yeoh received the award for her performance in everything everywhere all at once. the th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite, based on activists perception that its allwhite acting nominee list reflected bias. in response, the academy initiated historic changes in membership by . some media critics claim the academys efforts to address its purported racial, gender and national biases are merely distractions. by contrast, the golden globe awards already have multiple winners of asian descent in leading actress categories. some question whether the academys definition of merit is just or empowering for nonamericans.

the academy doesnt have any rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting, and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either best actor/actress or best supporting actor/actress. this has led situations where a film has two or more coleads, and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other, and to increase the films chances of winning. this practice has been derisively called category fraud. for example, rooney mara was nominated for best supporting actress for carol , despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to cate blanchett, who was nominated for best actress. another example is once upon a time in hollywood , where brad pitt was nominated for and won best supporting actor, even though he played an equally important role to best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio. in both these cases, critics argued that the weinstein company, the studio behind the former film, had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their colead.

acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity, to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work.

following the st academy awards in february  in which the netflixbroadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category, steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services. spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscarwinning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picturenominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatricalrun status to qualify for an oscar.the united states department of justice, having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the academy in march , cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise antitrust concerns against the academy. following its april  board meeting, the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.

during the th academy awards on march , , chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head with a g.i. jane reference. will smith walked onstage and slapped rock across the face, then returned to his seat and told rock, twice, to keep my wifes name out of your fucking mouth while later accepting the best actor award for king richard, smith apologized to the academy and the other nominees, but not to rock. rock decided not to press charges against smith.on april , , the academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson informing the public that will smith had received a tenyear ban from attending the oscars as a result of the incident.

some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars. the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols . nichols boycotted the th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild. nichols eventually accepted the  award three years later, at the  ceremony. nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career.

george c. scott became the second person to refuse his award  at the rd academy awards ceremony. scott described it as a meat parade, saying, i dont want any part of it.the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando, who refused his award , citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans. at the th academy awards ceremony, brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was booing and cheering by the audience. littlefeather was much later discovered to have falsely misrepresented her ancestry as native american, that is, she was found to be a pretendian.

australia, officially the commonwealth of australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the australian continent, the island of tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. australia is the largest country by area in oceania and the worlds sixthlargest country. australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. it is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the northeast, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the southeast. 

the ancestors of aboriginal australians began arriving from southeast asia , to , years ago, during the last ice age. arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately  distinct language groups by the time of european settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world. australias written history commenced with the european maritime exploration of australia. the dutch navigator willem janszoon was the first known european to reach australia, in . in , the british explorer james cook mapped and claimed the east coast of australia for great britain, and the first fleet of british ships arrived at sydney in  to establish the penal colony of new south wales. the european population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by european settlers and an additional five selfgoverning british colonies established. democratic parliaments were gradually established through the th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the commonwealth of australia on  january . this began a process of increasing autonomy from the united kingdom, highlighted by the statute of westminster adoption act , and culminating in the australia act .australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. australias population of nearly  million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. canberra is the nations capital, while its most populous city and financial centre is sydney. the next four largest cities are melbourne, brisbane, perth, and adelaide. it is ethnically diverse and multicultural, the product of largescale immigration, with almost half of the population having at least one parent born overseas. australias abundant natural resources and welldeveloped international trade relations are crucial to the countrys economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education. australia ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.australia has a highly developed market economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally. australia is a regional power, and has the worlds thirteenthhighest military expenditure. it is a member of international groupings including the united nations; the g; the oecd; the world trade organization; asiapacific economic cooperation; the pacific islands forum; the pacific community; the commonwealth of nations; and the defence/security organisations anzus, aukus, and the five eyes. it is a major nonnato ally of the united states.

the name australia  is derived from the latin terra australis , a name used for a hypothetical continent in the southern hemisphere since ancient times. several sixteenth century cartographers used the word australia on maps, but not to identify modern australia. when europeans began visiting and mapping australia in the th century, the name terra australis was naturally applied to the new territories.until the early th century, australia was best known as new holland, a name first applied by the dutch explorer abel tasman in   and subsequently anglicised. terra australis still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts. the name australia was popularised by the explorer matthew flinders, who said it was more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth. the first time that australia appears to have been officially used was in april , when governor lachlan macquarie acknowledged the receipt of flinders charts of australia from lord bathurst. in december , macquarie recommended to the colonial office that it be formally adopted. in , the admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name. the first official published use of the new name came with the publication in  of the australia directory by the hydrographic office.colloquial names for australia include oz and the land down under . other epithets include the great southern land, the lucky country, the sunburnt country, and the wide brown land. the latter two both derive from dorothea mackellars  poem my country.

indigenous australians comprise two broad groups the aboriginal peoples of the australian mainland , and the torres strait islanders, who are a distinct melanesian people. human habitation of the australian continent is estimated to have begun , to , years ago, with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now southeast asia. it is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern aboriginal australians. the madjedbebe rock shelter in arnhem land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in australia. the oldest human remains found are the lake mungo remains, which have been dated to around , years ago.aboriginal australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on earth. at the time of first european contact, aboriginal australians were complex huntergatherers with diverse economies and societies and about  different language groups. recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of , could have been sustained. aboriginal australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the dreamtime.the torres strait islander people first settled their islands around  years ago. culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas.

the northern coasts and waters of australia were visited sporadically for trade by makassan fishermen from what is now indonesia. the first recorded european sighting of the australian mainland, and the first recorded european landfall on the australian continent, are attributed to the dutch. the first ship and crew to chart the australian coast and meet with aboriginal people was the duyfken, captained by dutch navigator willem janszoon. he sighted the coast of cape york peninsula in early , and made landfall on  february  at the pennefather river near the modern town of weipa on cape york. later that year, spanish explorer luís vaz de torres sailed through and navigated the torres strait islands. the dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent new holland during the th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made, a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the batavia in , marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first europeans to permanently inhabit the continent. in , captain james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named new south wales and claimed for great britain.following the loss of its american colonies in , the british government sent a fleet of ships, the first fleet, under the command of captain arthur phillip, to establish a new penal colony in new south wales. a camp was set up and the union flag raised at sydney cove, port jackson, on  january , a date which later became australias national day. most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to free settlers . while the majority of convicts settled into colonial society once emancipated, convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged, but invariably suppressed under martial law. the  rum rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in australia, instigated a twoyear period of military rule. the following decade, social and economic reforms initiated by governor lachlan macquarie saw new south wales transition from a penal colony to a civil society.the indigenous population declined for  years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease. thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.

the british continued to push into other areas of the continent in the early th century, initially along the coast. in , a settlement was established in van diemens land , and in , gregory blaxland, william lawson and william wentworth crossed the blue mountains west of sydney, opening the interior to european settlement. the british claim extended to the whole australian continent in  when major edmund lockyer established a settlement on king george sound . the swan river colony  was established in , evolving into the largest australian colony by area, western australia. in accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from new south wales tasmania in , south australia in , new zealand in , victoria in , and queensland in . south australia was founded as a free provinceit was never a penal colony. western australia was also founded free but later accepted transported convicts, the last of which arrived in , decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies.in , a legislative council nominated by the governor of new south wales was established, together with a new supreme court, thus limiting the powers of colonial governors. between  and , the six colonies individually gained responsible government, thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire. the colonial office in london retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs and defence.in the midth century, explorers such as burke and wills went further inland to determine its agricultural potential and answer scientific questions. a series of gold rushes beginning in the early s led to an influx of new migrants from china, north america and continental europe, as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in  when ballarat miners launched the eureka rebellion against gold license fees.from , australian colonial governments began introducing policies resulting in the removal of many aboriginal children from their families and communities .

on  january , federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the commonwealth of australia as a nation and the entering into force of the australian constitution.after the  imperial conference, australia and several other selfgoverning british settler colonies were given the status of selfgoverning dominions within the british empire. australia was one of the founding members of the league of nations in , and subsequently of the united nations in . britains statute of westminster  formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the united kingdom. australia adopted it in , but it was backdated to  to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the australian parliament during world war ii.the federal capital territory  was formed in  as the location for the future federal capital of canberra. melbourne was the temporary seat of government from  to  while canberra was being constructed. the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the federal parliament in . australia became the colonial ruler of the territory of papua  in  and of the territory of new guinea  in . the two were unified as the territory of papua and new guinea in  and gained independence from australia in .

in , australia joined the allies in fighting the first world war, and took part in many of the major battles fought on the western front. of about , who served, about , were killed and another , were wounded. many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps  at gallipoli in  as the nations baptism of fireits first major military action, with the anniversary of the landing at anzac cove commemorated each year on anzac day.from  to , australia joined the allies in fighting the second world war. australias armed forces fought in the pacific, european and mediterranean and middle east theatres. the shock of britains defeat in asia in , followed soon after by the bombing of darwin and other japanese attacks on australian soil, led to a widespread belief in australia that a japanese invasion was imminent, and a shift from the united kingdom to the united states as australias principal ally and security partner. since , australia has been a formal military ally of the united states, under the anzus treaty.

in the decades following world war ii, australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development. using the slogan populate or perish, the nation encouraged a large wave of immigration from across europe, with such immigrants referred to as new australians.a member of the western bloc during the cold war, australia participated in the korean war and the malayan emergency during the s and the vietnam war from  to . during this time, tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the menzies government to ban the communist party of australia, and a bitter splitting of the labor party in .as a result of a  referendum, the federal government received a mandate to implement policies to benefit aboriginal people, and all indigenous australians were included in the census. traditional ownership of land  was recognised in law for the first time when the high court of australia held in mabo v queensland  that the legal doctrine of terra nullius  did not apply to australia at the time of european settlement.following the final abolition of the white australia policy in , australias demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of noneuropean immigration, mostly from asia. the late th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other pacific rim nations. while the australia act  severed the remaining vestigial constitutional ties between australia and the united kingdom, a  referendum resulted in  of voters rejecting a proposal to abolish the monarchy of australia and become a republic.following the september  attacks on the united states, australia joined the united states in fighting the afghanistan war from  to  and the iraq war from  to . the nations trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards east asia in the st century, with china becoming the nations largest trading partner by a large margin.during the covid pandemic which commenced in australia in , several of australias largest cities were locked down for extended periods of time, and free movement across state borders was restricted in an attempt to slow the spread of the sarscov virus.

surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans, australia is separated from asia by the arafura and timor seas, with the coral sea lying off the queensland coast, and the tasman sea lying between australia and new zealand. the worlds smallest continent and sixth largest country by total area, australiaowing to its size and isolationis often dubbed the island continent and is sometimes considered the worlds largest island. australia has , km  of coastline , and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of ,, square kilometres . this exclusive economic zone does not include the australian antarctic territory.mainland australia lies between latitudes  and  south, and longitudes  and  east. australias size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the northeast, mountain ranges in the southeast, southwest and east, and desert in the centre. the desert or semiarid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. australia is the driest inhabited continent; its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than  mm. the population density is . inhabitants per square kilometre, although the large majority of the population lives along the temperate southeastern coastline. the population density exceeds , inhabitants per square kilometre in central melbourne.

the great barrier reef, the worlds largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the northeast coast and extends for over , km . mount augustus, claimed to be the worlds largest monolith, is located in western australia. at , m , mount kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the australian mainland. even taller are mawson peak , on the remote australian external territory of heard island, and, in the australian antarctic territory, mount mcclintock and mount menzies, at , m  and , m  respectively.eastern australia is marked by the great dividing range, which runs parallel to the coast of queensland, new south wales and much of victoria. the name is not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills, and the highlands are typically no more than , m  in height. the coastal uplands and a belt of brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland. these include the western plains of new south wales, and the mitchell grass downs and mulga lands of inland queensland. the northernmost point of the mainland is the tropical cape york peninsula.

the landscapes of the top end and the gulf countrywith their tropical climateinclude forest, woodland, wetland, grassland, rainforest and desert. at the northwest corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of the kimberley, and below that the pilbara. the victoria plains tropical savanna lies south of the kimberley and arnhem land savannas, forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts. at the heart of the country are the uplands of central australia. prominent features of the centre and south include uluru , the famous sandstone monolith, and the inland simpson, tirari and sturt stony, gibson, great sandy, tanami, and great victoria deserts, with the famous nullarbor plain on the southern coast. the western australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and mediterraneanclimate southwest australia.

lying on the indoaustralian plate, the mainland of australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on earth with a relatively stable geological history. the landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over . billion years of the earths history. the pilbara craton is one of only two pristine archaean .. ga  crusts identified on the earth.having been part of all major supercontinents, the australian continent began to form after the breakup of gondwana in the permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the african continent and indian subcontinent. it separated from antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the permian and continuing through to the cretaceous. when the last glacial period ended in about , bc, rising sea levels formed bass strait, separating tasmania from the mainland. then between about , and , bc, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating new guinea, the aru islands, and the mainland of australia. the australian continent is moving toward eurasia at the rate of  to  centimetres a year.the australian mainlands continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of  km, with a range in thickness from  km to  km. australias geology can be divided into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west to east the archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west, proterozoic fold belts in the centre and phanerozoic sedimentary basins, metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east.the australian mainland and tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes, but due to passing over the east australia hotspot, recent volcanism has occurred during the holocene, in the newer volcanics province of western victoria and southeastern south australia. volcanism also occurs in the island of new guinea , and in the australian external territory of heard island and mcdonald islands. seismic activity in the australian mainland and tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the  newcastle earthquake.

the climate of australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the indian ocean dipole and the el niñosouthern oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical lowpressure system that produces cyclones in northern australia. these factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summerrainfall . the southwest corner of the country has a mediterranean climate. the southeast ranges from oceanic  to humid subtropical , with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. the interior is arid to semiarid.driven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than c since . associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires.  was australias warmest recorded year, and the  bushfire season was the countrys worst on record. australias greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world.water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought. throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout eastern australia in the early s after the s australian drought.

although most of australia is semiarid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. fungi typify that diversityan estimated , speciesof which only  have been describedoccur in australia. because of the continents great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and longterm geographic isolation, much of australias biota is unique. about  of flowering plants,  of mammals, more than  of birds, and  of inshore, temperatezone fish are endemic. australia has at least  species of reptile, more than any other country in the world. besides antarctica, australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. feral cats may have been introduced in the th century by dutch shipwrecks, and later in the th century by european settlers. they are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species. seafaring immigrants from asia are believed to have brought the dingo to australia sometime after the end of the last ice ageperhaps  years agoand aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland. australia is also one of  megadiverse countries.australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species, particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions; wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts. among wellknown australian animals are the monotremes ; a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, and wombat, and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra. australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world. the dingo was introduced by austronesian people who traded with indigenous australians around  bce. many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement, including the australian megafauna; others have disappeared since european settlement, among them the thylacine.many of australias ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced animal, chromistan, fungal and plant species. all these factors have led to australias having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world. the federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act  is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species. numerous protected areas have been created under the national strategy for the conservation of australias biological diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;  wetlands are listed under the ramsar convention, and  natural world heritage sites have been established. australia was ranked st out of  countries in the world on the  environmental performance index. there are more than , animals and plants on australias threatened species list, including more than  animals.paleontologists discovered a fossil site of a prehistoric rainforest in mcgraths flat, in south australia, that presents evidence that this now arid desert and dry shrubland/grassland was once home to an abundance of life.

australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy. the country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution, which is one of the worlds oldest, since federation in . it is also one of the worlds oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. the australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the united kingdom  and the united states , along with distinctive indigenous features.the federal government is separated into three branches

legislature the bicameral parliament, comprising the monarch , the senate, and the house of representatives;

executive the federal executive council, which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet, comprising the prime minister and other ministers of state appointed by the governorgeneral on the advice of parliament;

judiciary the high court of australia and other federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the governorgeneral on advice of parliamentcharles iii reigns as king of australia and is represented in australia by the governorgeneral at the federal level and by the governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of his ministers. thus, in practice the governorgeneral acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the federal executive council. the governorgeneral, however, does have reserve powers which, in some situations, may be exercised outside the prime ministers request. these powers are held by convention and their scope is unclear. the most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of .

in the senate , there are  senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories . the house of representatives  has  members elected from singlemember electoral divisions, commonly known as electorates or seats, allocated to states on the basis of population, with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats. elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously; senators have overlapping sixyear terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house; thus only  of the  places in the senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.australias electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of tasmania and the act which, along with the senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens  years and over in every jurisdiction, as is enrolment. the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister. in cases where no party has majority support, the governorgeneral has the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of parliament. due to the relatively unique position of australia operating as a westminster parliamentary democracy with an elected upper house, the system has sometimes been referred to as having a washminster mutation, or as a semiparliamentary system.there are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states the australian labor party and the coalition, which is a formal grouping of the liberal party and its minor partner, the national party. the liberal national party and the country liberal party are merged state branches in queensland and the northern territory that function as separate parties at a federal level. within australian political culture, the coalition is considered centreright and the labor party is considered centreleft. independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. the australian greens are often considered the third force in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and membership.the most recent federal election was held on  may  and resulted in the australian labor party, led by anthony albanese, being elected to government.

australia has six statesnew south wales , queensland , south australia , tasmania , victoria  and western australia and three mainland territoriesthe australian capital territory , the northern territory , and the jervis bay territory . the act and nt are mostly selfgoverning, except that the commonwealth parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.under the constitution, the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject, whereas the commonwealth  parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section . for example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the commonwealth parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas. however, commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.each state and major mainland territory has its own parliamentunicameral in the northern territory, the act and queensland, and bicameral in the other states. the states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the commonwealth as defined by the constitution. the lower houses are known as the legislative assembly ; the upper houses are known as the legislative council. the head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister. the king is represented in each state by a governor. in the commonwealth, the kings representative is the governorgeneral.the commonwealth parliament also directly administers the external territories of ashmore and cartier islands, christmas island, the cocos  islands, the coral sea islands, heard island and mcdonald islands, and the claimed region of australian antarctic territory, as well as the internal jervis bay territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of new south wales. the external territory of norfolk island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the norfolk island act  through its own legislative assembly and an administrator to represent the monarch. in , the commonwealth parliament abolished selfgovernment, integrating norfolk island into the australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. macquarie island is part of tasmania, and lord howe island of new south wales.

over recent decades, australias foreign relations have been driven by a focus on relationships within the asiapacific region and a continued close association with the united states through the anzus pact and its status as a major nonnato ally of that country. a regional power, australia is a member of regional and cultural groupings including the pacific islands forum, the pacific community and the commonwealth of nations, and is a participant in the asean mechanism and the east asia summit.

australia is a member of several defence, intelligence and security groupings including the five eyes intelligence alliance with the united states, united kingdom, canada and new zealand; the anzus alliance with the united states and new zealand; the aukus security treaty with the united states and united kingdom; the quadrilateral security dialogue with the united states, india and japan; the five power defence arrangements with new zealand, the united kingdom, malaysia and singapore; and the reciprocal access defence and security agreement with japan.

australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation. it led the formation of the cairns group and asiapacific economic cooperation, and is a member of the organisation for economic cooperation and development  and the world trade organization . in recent decades, australia has entered into the comprehensive and progressive agreement for transpacific partnership and the regional comprehensive economic partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the united states, china, japan, south korea, indonesia, the united kingdom and new zealand.australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring new zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the transtasman travel arrangement and free trade under the closer economic relations agreement. the most favourably viewed countries by the australian people in  include new zealand, the united kingdom, japan, germany, taiwan, thailand, the united states and south korea. a founding member country of the united nations, australia is strongly committed to multilateralism, and maintains an international aid program under which some  countries receive assistance. australia ranked fourth in the center for global developments  commitment to development index.

australias armed forcesthe australian defence force comprise the royal australian navy , the australian army and the royal australian air force , in total numbering , personnel  as of november . the titular role of commanderinchief is vested in the governorgeneral, who appoints a chief of the defence force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government. in a diarchy, the chief of the defence force serves as cochairman of the defence committee, conjointly with the secretary of defence, in the command and control of the australian defence organisation.in the  budget, defence spending comprised  of gdp, representing the worlds th largest defence budget. australia has been involved in united nations and regional peacekeeping, disaster relief, as well as armed conflicts from the first world war onwards.

legal and social rights in australia are regarded as among the most developed in the world. attitudes towards lgbt people are generally positive within australia, and samesex marriage has been legal in the nation since . australia has had antidiscrimination laws regarding disability since .

australias highincome mixedmarket economy is rich in natural resources. it is the worlds fourteenthlargest by nominal terms, and the thlargest by ppp. as of , it has the secondhighest amount of wealth per adult, after luxembourg, and has the thirteenthhighest financial assets per capita. australia has a labour force of some . million, with an unemployment rate of . as of june . according to the australian council of social service, the poverty rate of australia exceeds . of the population, encompassing . million. it also estimated that there were ,  children under the age of  living in relative poverty. the australian dollar is the national currency, which is also shared with three island states in the pacific kiribati, nauru, and tuvalu.australian government debt, about  billion, exceeds . of the countrys total gdp, and is the worlds eighthhighest. australia had the secondhighest level of household debt in the world in , after switzerland. its house prices are among the highest in the world, especially in the large urban areas. the large service sector accounts for about . of total gdp, followed by the industrial sector , while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only . of total gdp. australia is the worlds stlargest exporter and thlargest importer. china is australias largest trading partner by a wide margin, accounting for roughly  of the countrys exports and . of its imports. other major export markets include japan, the united states, and south korea.australia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom, and was ranked fifth in the human development index in . as of , it is ranked twelfth in the index of economic freedom and nineteenth in the global competitiveness report. it attracted . million international tourists in , and was ranked thirteenth among the countries of asiapacific in  for inbound tourism. the  travel and tourism competitiveness report ranked australia seventhhighest in the world out of  countries. its international tourism receipts in  amounted to . billion.

in , australias energy sources were coal , hydropower , natural gas , liquid/gas fossil fuelswitching plants , oil , and other renewable resources like wind power, solar energy, and bioenergy . during the st century, australia has been trending to generate more energy using renewable resources and less energy using fossil fuels. in , australia used coal for  of all energy , wind power for . , natural gas for . , solar power for . , hydropower for . , bioenergy for . , and other sources like oil and waste coal mine gas for ..in august , australias government set a goal to achieve  of all energy in the country from renewable sources by . they achieved this goal, as renewable resources accounted for . of australias energy in .

the trump administration separated more than , children of migrant families from their parents at the u.s.mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of . in april , the trump administration announced a zero tolerance policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted. this resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors. administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.the policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage. trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming democrats, despite the separations being his administrations policy.although trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on june , , mandating that migrant families be detained together unless there is a concern doing so would pose a risk to the child. on june , , judge dana sabraw concluded that the trump administration had no system in place to keep track of the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification; sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances. after the federalcourt order, the trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the aclu contended that the trump administration had abused its discretion and asked sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.

one of trumps central campaign promises was to build a ,mile  border wall to mexico and have mexico pay for it. by the end of his term, the u.s. had built  miles  km of new primary wall and  miles  km of secondary wall in locations where there had been no barriers and  miles  of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.in , trump refused to sign any appropriations bill from congress unless it allocated . billion in funds for the border wall, resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for  days from december  to january , the longest u.s. government shutdown in history. around , government employees were furloughed or worked without pay. trump and congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall. the shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of  billion to the economy, according to the congressional budget office. about half of those polled blamed trump for the shutdown, and trumps approval ratings dropped.to prevent another imminent shutdown in february , congress passed and trump signed a funding bill that included . billion for  miles  of bollard border fencing. trump also declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the united states, intending to divert . billion of funds congress had allocated to other purposes. trump vetoed a joint resolution to overturn the declaration, and the senate voted against a veto override. legal challenges to the diversion of . billion originally meant for the department of defenses drug interdiction efforts and . billion originally meant for military construction were unsuccessful.

before and during his presidency, trump repeatedly accused china of taking unfair advantage of the u.s. as president, trump launched a trade war against china that was widely characterized as a failure, sanctioned huawei for its alleged ties to iran, significantly increased visa restrictions on chinese students and scholars, and classified china as a currency manipulator. trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on china with praise of chinese communist party leader xi jinping, which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader. after initially praising china for its handling of the covid pandemic, he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in march .trump said he resisted punishing china for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the northwestern xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations. in july , the trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior chinese officials, in response to expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million of the countrys uyghur muslim ethnic minority.

in , when north koreas nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat, trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that north korean aggression would be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. in , trump declared that he wanted north koreas complete denuclearization, and engaged in namecalling with leader kim jong un.after this period of tension, trump and kim exchanged at least  letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship. trump met kim three times in singapore in , in hanoi in , and in the korean demilitarized zone in . trump became the first sitting u.s. president to meet a north korean leader or to set foot on north korean soil. trump also lifted some u.s. sanctions against north korea.however, no denuclearization agreement was reached, and talks in october  broke down after one day. while conducting no nuclear tests since , north korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

u.s. troop numbers in afghanistan increased from , in january  to , a year later, reversing trumps preelection position critical of further involvement in afghanistan. in february , the trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in  months contingent on a guarantee from the taliban that afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the united states or its allies and for the u.s. to seek the release of , taliban imprisoned by the afghan government. by the end of trumps term, , taliban had been released, and, despite the taliban continuing attacks on afghan forces and integrating alqaeda members into its leadership, u.s. troops had been reduced to ,.

the trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among white house staff. by the end of trumps first year in office,  percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. as of early july ,  percent of trumps senior aides had left and  staffers had left in the previous year. both figures set a record for recent presidentsmore change in the first  months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years. notable early departures included national security advisor flynn , and press secretary sean spicer. close personal aides to trump including bannon, hope hicks, john mcentee, and keith schiller quit or were forced out. some, including hicks and mcentee, later returned to the white house in different posts. trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.trump had four white house chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several. reince priebus was replaced after seven months by retired marine general john f. kelly. kelly resigned in december  after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and trump subsequently disparaged him. kelly was succeeded by mick mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in march  by mark meadows.on may , , trump dismissed fbi director james comey. while initially attributing this action to comeys conduct in the investigation about hillary clintons emails, trump said a few days later that he was concerned with comeys roles in the ongoing trumprussia investigations, and that he had intended to fire comey earlier. at a private conversation in february, trump said he hoped comey would drop the investigation into flynn. in march and april, trump asked comey to lift the cloud impairing his ability to act by saying publicly that the fbi was not investigating him.turnover was relatively high within the trump cabinet. trump lost three of his  original cabinet members within his first year. health and human services secretary tom price was forced to resign in september  due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft. environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt resigned in  and secretary of the interior ryan zinke in january  amid multiple investigations into their conduct.trump was slow to appoint secondtier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. in october , there were still hundreds of subcabinet positions without a nominee. by january , , of  key positions,  had been filled  and trump had no nominee for  .

trump appointed  article iii judges, including  to the courts of appeals and three to the supreme court neil gorsuch, brett kavanaugh, and amy coney barrett. trumps supreme court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the supreme court to the right. in the  campaign, trump pledged that roe v. wade would be overturned automatically if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three prolife justices. trump later took credit when roe was overturned in dobbs v. jackson womens health organization; all three of his supreme court nominees voted with the majority.trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciarys constitutional authority. trumps attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of trumps statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.

in december , covid erupted in wuhan, china; the sarscov virus spread worldwide within weeks. the first confirmed case in the u.s. was reported on january , . the outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by health and human services  secretary alex azar on january , .trumps public statements on covid were at odds with his private statements. in february  trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the u.s. was less deadly than influenza, was very much under control, and would soon be over. at the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with bob woodward. in march , trump privately told woodward that he was deliberately playing it down in public so as not to create panic.

trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and secretary azar. throughout january and february he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger. by midmarch, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.on march , trump signed the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act into law, which provided . billion in emergency funding for federal agencies. on march , the world health organization  recognized the spread of covid as a pandemic, and trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of europe, effective march . that same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide oval office address, calling the outbreak horrible but a temporary moment and saying there was no financial crisis. on march , he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources. trump falsely claimed that anybody that wants a test can get a test, despite the availability of tests being severely limited.in september , the trump administration terminated united states agency for international developments predict program, a  million epidemiological research program initiated in  to provide early warning of pandemics abroad. the program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. one such laboratory was the wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes covid. after revival in april , the program was given two month extensions to help fight covid in the u.s. and other countries.on april , trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the united states. in late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.

trump established the white house coronavirus task force on january , . beginning in midmarch, trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials, sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments. trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate joe biden, and denounced the press. on march , he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur. his repeated use of the terms chinese virus and china virus to describe covid drew criticism from health experts.by early april, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administrations response, trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, democratic state governors, the previous administration, china, and the world health organization . the daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late april, after a briefing at which trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat covid; the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.in early may, trump proposed the phaseout of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. amid a backlash, trump said the task force would indefinitely continue. by the end of may, the coronavirus task forces meetings were sharply reduced.

prior to the pandemic, trump criticized the world health organization  and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of u.s. aid. his administrations proposed  federal budget, released in february, proposed reducing who funding by more than half. in may and april, trump accused the who of severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus and alleged without evidence that the organization was under chinese control and had enabled the chinese governments concealment of the origins of the pandemic. he then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization. trumps criticisms and actions regarding the who were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic. in july , trump announced the formal withdrawal of the united states from the who effective july . the decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as shortsighted, senseless, and dangerous.

in june and july, trump said several times that the u.s. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases makes us look bad. the cdc guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be quickly identified and tested even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus. in august  the cdc quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, do not necessarily need a test. the change in guidelines was made by hhs political appointees under trump administration pressure, against the wishes of cdc scientists. the day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.

in april , republicanconnected groups organized antilockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; trump encouraged the protests on twitter, even though the targeted states did not meet the trump administrations own guidelines for reopening. in april , he first supported, then later criticized, georgia governor brian kemps plan to reopen some nonessential businesses. throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the countrys economy.trump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administrations april  guidance that americans should wear masks in public and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus. by june, trump had said masks were a doubleedged sword; ridiculed biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that maskwearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally. trumps contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.despite record numbers of covid cases in the u.s. from midjune onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early july  that  percent of covid cases are totally harmless. he also began insisting that all states should open schools to inperson education in the fall despite a july spike in reported cases.

trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored, such as approving unproven treatments or speeding up the approval of vaccines. trump administration political appointees at hhs sought to control cdc communications to the public that undermined trumps claims that the pandemic was under control. cdc resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed hhs personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. trump alleged without evidence that fda scientists were part of a deep state opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.

on october , , trump tweeted that he had tested positive for covid. his wife, their son barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.later that day trump was hospitalized at walter reed national military medical center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. he was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. he returned to the white house on october , still struggling with the disease. during and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus. in , it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.

by july , trumps handling of the covid pandemic had become a major issue for the  presidential election. biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election. polls suggested voters blamed trump for his pandemic response and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an ipsos/abc news poll indicating  percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response. in the final months of the campaign, trump repeatedly claimed that the u.s. was rounding the turn in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths. a few days before the november  election, the united states reported more than , cases in a single day for the first time.

after he assumed office, trump was the subject of increasing justice department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. there were  investigations of trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.in april , the house oversight committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from trumps banks, deutsche bank and capital one, and his accounting firm, mazars usa. trump then sued the banks, mazars, and committee chair elijah cummings to prevent the disclosures. in may, dc district court judge amit mehta ruled that mazars must comply with the subpoena, and judge edgardo ramos of the southern district court of new york ruled that the banks must also comply. trumps attorneys appealed the rulings. in september , the committee and trump agreed to a settlement about mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.

during the  presidential election campaign, american media, inc. , the parent company of the national enquirer, and a company set up by cohen paid playboy model karen mcdougal and adult film actress stormy daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with trump between  and . cohen pleaded guilty in  to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of trump to influence the presidential election. trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of cohens payment to daniels, but he reimbursed him in . federal prosecutors asserted that trump had been involved in discussions regarding nondisclosure payments as early as . court documents showed that the fbi believed trump was directly involved in the payment to daniels, based on calls he had with cohen in october . federal prosecutors closed the investigation in , but the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed the trump organization and ami for records related to the payments and trump and the trump organization for eight years of tax returns. in november , the new york times reported that manhattan prosecutors were newly optimistic about building a case against trump.

in january , american intelligence agenciesthe cia, the fbi, and the nsa, represented by the director of national intelligencejointly stated with high confidence that the russian government interfered in the  presidential election to favor the election of trump. in march , fbi director james comey told congress, the fbi, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the russian governments efforts to interfere in the  presidential election. that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the trump campaign and the russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and russias efforts. many suspicious links between trump associates and russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between russians and team trump were widely reported by the press.manafort, one of trumps campaign managers, worked from december  to february  to help prorussian politician viktor yanukovych win the ukrainian presidency. other trump associates, including flynn and stone, were connected to russian officials. russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use manafort and flynn to influence trump. members of trumps campaign and later his white house staff, particularly flynn, were in contact with russian officials both before and after the november election. on december , , flynn talked with russian ambassador sergey kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled pence. trump told kislyak and sergei lavrov in may  he was unconcerned about russian interference in u.s. elections.trump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that ukraine, rather than russia, interfered in the  electionwhich was also promoted by russia to frame ukraine. after the democratic national committee was hacked, trump first claimed it withheld its server from the fbi ; second, that crowdstrike, the company that investigated the servers, was ukrainebased and ukrainianowned ; and third that the server was hidden in ukraine. members of the trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.

in july , the fbi launched an investigation, codenamed crossfire hurricane, into possible links between russia and the trump campaign. after trump fired fbi director james comey in may , the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into trumps personal and business dealings with russia. crossfire hurricane was transferred to the mueller investigation, but deputy attorney general rod rosenstein ended the investigation into trumps direct ties to russia while giving the bureau the false impression that mueller would pursue the matter.

in may , deputy attorney general rod rosenstein appointed robert mueller, a former director of the fbi, special counsel for the department of justice , ordering him to examine any links and/or coordination between the russian government and the trump campaign. he privately told mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters in connection with russias  election interference. the special counsel also investigated whether trumps dismissal of james comey as fbi director constituted obstruction of justice and the trump campaigns possible ties to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, turkey, qatar, israel, and china. trump sought to fire mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.in march , mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to attorney general william barr. two days later, barr sent a letter to congress purporting to summarize the reports main conclusions. a federal court, as well as mueller himself, said barr mischaracterized the investigations conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public. trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.a redacted version of the report was publicly released in april . it found that russia interfered in  to favor trumps candidacy and hinder clintons. despite numerous links between the russian government and the trump campaign, the report found that the prevailing evidence did not establish that trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with russian interference. the report revealed sweeping russian interference and detailed how trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing they would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts.the report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by trump but did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment on whether trump broke the law, suggesting that congress should make such a determination. investigators decided they could not apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the president committed crimes as an office of legal counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted, and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. the report concluded that congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, may apply the obstruction laws. the house of representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the trumpukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the mueller investigation.several trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with muellers investigation and related cases, including manafort, convicted on eight felony counts, deputy campaign manager rick gates, foreign policy advisor papadopoulos, and flynn. cohen pleaded guilty to lying to congress about trumps  attempts to reach a deal with russia to build a trump tower in moscow. cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of trump, who was identified as individual in the court documents. in february , stone was sentenced to  months in prison for lying to congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked democratic emails during the  election. the sentencing judge said stone was prosecuted for covering up for the president.

in august , a whistleblower filed a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community about a july  phone call between trump and president of ukraine volodymyr zelenskyy, during which trump had pressured zelenskyy to investigate crowdstrike and democratic presidential candidate biden and his son hunter. the whistleblower said that the white house had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the trump administration and trump attorney rudy giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from ukraine in july  and canceling pences may  ukraine trip.house speaker nancy pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on september . trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision. on september , the trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after zelenskyy mentioned purchasing american antitank missiles, trump asked him to discuss investigating biden and his son with giuliani and barr. the testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further trumps personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election. in october, william b. taylor jr., the chargé daffaires for ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in ukraine in june , he found that zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by trump and led by giuliani. according to taylor and others, the goal was to coerce zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed hunter biden, as well as rumors about ukrainian involvement in the  u.s. presidential election. he said it was made clear that until zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for ukraine and not invite zelenskyy to the white house.on december , the house judiciary committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of congress. after debate, the house of representatives impeached trump on both articles on december .

during the trial in january , the house impeachment managers presented their case for three days. they cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress, and asserted that trumps actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the constitutions impeachment process.

responding over the next three days, trumps lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said trump had not broken any laws or obstructed congress. they argued that the impeachment was constitutionally and legally invalid because trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.on january , the senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents;  republicans formed the majority for this vote. the impeachment trial was the first in u.s. history without witness testimony.trump was acquitted of both charges by the republican majority,  on abuse of power and  on obstruction of congress. senator mitt romney was the only republican who voted to convict trump on one charge, the abuse of power. following his acquittal, trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.

breaking with precedent, trump filed to run for a second term with the fec within a few hours of assuming the presidency. he held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office and officially became the republican nominee in august .in his first two years in office, trumps reelection committee reported raising . million and began  with . million in cash. by july , the trump campaign and the republican party had raised . billion and spent  million, losing their cash advantage over biden. the cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if biden won the presidency. trump repeatedly misrepresented bidens positions and shifted to appeals to racism.

starting in spring , trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud. in july, trump raised the idea of delaying the election. when, in august, the house of representatives voted for a  billion grant to the u.s. postal service for the expected surge in mail voting, trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. he repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.biden won the election on november , receiving . million votes  to trumps . million  and  electoral college votes to trumps .

at  a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, trump declared victory. after biden was projected the winner days later, trump stated that this election is far from over and baselessly alleged election fraud. trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least  judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis. trumps unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials. after cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  director chris krebs contradicted trumps fraud allegations, trump dismissed him on november . on december , the u.s. supreme court declined to hear a case from the texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by biden.trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election. he initially blocked government officials from cooperating in bidens presidential transition. after three weeks, the administrator of the general services administration declared biden the apparent winner of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team. trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the gsa begin transition protocols.the electoral college formalized bidens victory on december . from november to january, trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various republican local and state officeholders, republican state and federal legislators, the justice department, and vice president pence, urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for georgia officials to find votes and announce a recalculated result. on february , , georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into trumps efforts to subvert the election in georgia.trump did not attend bidens inauguration, leaving washington for florida hours before.

in december , newsweek reported the pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if trump decided to declare martial law. the pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.when trump moved supporters into positions of power at the pentagon after the november  election, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley and cia director gina haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against china or iran. milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed haspel and nsa director paul nakasone to monitor developments closely.

on january , , while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the united states capitol, trump held a noon rally at the ellipse, washington, d.c.. he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to take back our country by marching to the capitol to show strength and fight like hell. many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. around  p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of congress. during the violence, trump watched tv and posted messages on twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. at  p.m., trump tweeted that the rioters should go home with love  in peace, calling them great patriots and very special and repeating that the election was stolen from him. after the mob was removed from the capitol, congress reconvened and confirmed the biden election win in the early hours of the following morning. according to the department of justice, more than  police officers were injured, and five people died.in march , trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in june, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them.

on january , , an article of impeachment charging trump with incitement of insurrection against the u.s. government was introduced to the house. the house voted  to impeach trump on january , making him the first u.s. president to be impeached twice. ten republicans voted for the impeachmentthe most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.on february , following a fiveday senate trial, trump was acquitted when the senate voted  for conviction, falling ten votes short of the twothirds majority required to convict; seven republicans joined every democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any senate impeachment trial of a president or former president. most republicans voted to acquit trump, although some held him responsible but felt the senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents ; included in the latter group was mitch mcconnell.

at the end of his term, trump went to live at his maralago club. as provided for by the former presidents act, he established an office there to handle his postpresidential activities.trumps false claims concerning the  election were commonly referred to as the big lie in the press and by his critics. in may , trump and his supporters attempted to coopt the term, using it to refer to the election itself. the republican party used trumps false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor. as late as july , trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the  election by rescinding the states electoral votes for biden.trump resumed his campaignstyle rallies with an minute speech at the annual north carolina republican party convention on june , . on june , he held his first public rally since the january  rally that preceded the riot at the capitol.unlike other former presidents, trump continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modernday party boss. he continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the republican party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many republican candidates held at maralago. much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. in the  midterm elections he endorsed over  candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the  presidential election was stolen from him. a majority of candidates endorsed by him won in republican primary elections.trump registered a new company in february . trump media  technology group  was formed for providing social networking services to customers in the united states. in october , trump announced the planned merger of tmtg with digital world acquisition, a specialpurpose acquisition company . a main backer of the spac is chinabased financier arc group, who was reportedly involved in setting up the proposed merger. the transaction is under investigation by the u.s. securities and exchange commission.in february , tmtg launched truth social, a twitterlike socialmedia platform. as of march , trump media, which had taken  million from russiaconnected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.

trump was the only president to never reach a  percent approval rating in the gallup poll dating to . his approval ratings showed a recordhigh partisan gap  percent among republicans and  percent among democrats. until september , the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of  percent and a low of  percent. trump finished his term with an approval rating between  percent and  percentthe lowest of any president since modern polling beganand a recordlow average of  percent throughout his presidency.in gallups annual poll asking americans to name the man they admire the most, trump placed second to obama in  and , tied with obama for most admired man in , and was named most admired in . since gallup started conducting the poll in , trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.a gallup poll in  countries comparing the approval ratings of u.s. leadership between the years  and  found that trump led obama in job approval in only  countries, most of them nondemocracies; approval of u.s. leadership plummeted among allies and g countries. overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the george w. bush presidency. by mid, only  percent of international respondents to a nation pew research poll expressed confidence in trump, a lower score than those accorded to russias vladimir putin and chinas xi jinping.

as a candidate and as president, trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks to an extent unprecedented in american politics. his falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.trumps false and misleading statements were documented by factcheckers, including at the washington post, which tallied a total of , false or misleading statements made by trump over his fouryear term. trumps falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to  per day in his second year,  per day in his third year, and  per day in his final year.some of trumps falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the biggest inaugural crowd ever. others had more farreaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for covid in a press conference and on twitter. the claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the united states and panicbuying in africa and south asia. other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in england and wales to the spread of radical islamic terror, served trumps domestic political purposes. as a matter of principle, trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.despite the frequency of trumps falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies. the first time the washington post did so was in august , when it declared that some of trumps misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to stormy daniels and playboy model karen mcdougal, were lies.in , trump was a significant source of disinformation on mailin voting and misinformation on the covid pandemic. his attacks on mailin ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the  presidential election, while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.james pfiffner, professor of policy and government at george mason university, wrote in  that trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to wellknown facts; these lies are the most important of all trump lies. by calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by political power; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote pfiffner.

before and throughout his presidency, trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including obama birtherism, the clinton body count conspiracy theory, the conspiracy theory movement qanon, the global warming hoax theory, trump tower wiretapping allegations, a john f. kennedy assassination conspiracy theory involving rafael cruz, linking talk show host joe scarborough to the death of a staffer, alleged foulplay in the death of justice antonin scalia, alleged ukrainian interference in u.s. elections, and that osama bin laden was alive and obama and biden had members of navy seal team  killed. in at least two instances, trump clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question.during and since the  presidential election, trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting, voting machines changing or deleting trump votes, fraudulent mailin voting, throwing out trump votes, and finding suitcases full of biden votes.

research suggests trumps rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes. during his  campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the january , , storming of the u.s. capitol, cited trumps rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence. a nationwide review by abc news in may  identified at least  criminal cases from august  to april  in which trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.

trumps social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined twitter in . he tweeted frequently during the  election campaign and as president until twitter banned him in the final days of his term. trump often used twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining of the press. in june , a white house press secretary said that trumps tweets were official presidential statements. trump often announced terminations of administration officials over twitter.after years of criticism for allowing trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, twitter began to tag some of his tweets with factchecking warnings in may . in response, trump tweeted that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices and that he would strongly regulate or close them down. in the days after the storming of the united states capitol, trump was banned from facebook, instagram, twitter and other platforms. the loss of trumps social media presence diminished his ability to shape events and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on twitter. trumps early attempts to reestablish a social media presence were unsuccessful. in february , he launched social media platform truth social where he only attracted a fraction of his twitter following. elon musk, the new owner of twitter, reinstated trumps twitter account in november .

trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a lovehate relationship with the press. in the  campaign, trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the republican primaries. the new york times writer amy chozick wrote in  that trumps media dominance enthralled the public and created mustsee tv.as a candidate and as president, trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the fake news media and the enemy of the people. in , journalist lesley stahl recounted trumps saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.as president, trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical. his administration moved to revoke the press passes of two white house reporters, which were restored by the courts. in , a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the u.s., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of trump. the trump white house held about a hundred formal press briefings in , declining by half during  and to two in .trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press. in early , the trump campaign sued the new york times, the washington post, and cnn for defamation in opinion pieces about russian election interference. legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed. by march , the lawsuits against the new york times and cnn had been dismissed.

many of trumps comments and actions have been considered racist. in national polling, about half of respondents said that trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists. several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled trumps political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of trump voters. racist and islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for trump.in , he settled a  department of justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters. he has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the  central park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by dna evidence in . as of , he maintained this position.in , when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist birther conspiracy theory, alleging that barack obama, the first black u.s. president, was not born in the united states. in april, he claimed credit for pressuring the white house to publish the longform birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him very popular. in september , amid pressure, he acknowledged that obama was born in the u.s. in , he reportedly expressed birther views in private.according to an analysis in political science quarterly, trump made explicitly racist appeals to whites during his  presidential campaign. in particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming mexican immigrants were bringing drugs, theyre bringing crime, theyre rapists. his later comments about a mexicanamerican judge presiding over a civil suit regarding trump university were also criticized as racist.

trumps comments on the  farright rally in charlottesville, virginia, condemning this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides and stating that there were very fine people on both sides, were widely criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counterprotesters.in a january  oval office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, trump reportedly referred to el salvador, haiti, honduras, and african nations as shithole countries. his remarks were condemned as racist.in july , trump tweeted that four democratic congresswomenall from minorities, three of whom are nativeborn americansshould go back to the countries they came from. two days later the house of representatives voted , mostly along party lines, to condemn his racist comments. white nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days. trump continued to make similar remarks during his  campaign.

trump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media. he made lewd comments, demeaned womens looks, and called them names, such as dog, crazed, crying lowlife, face of a pig, or horseface.at least  women publicly accused trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under womens skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. trump has denied all of the allegations.in october , two days before the second presidential debate, a  hot mic recording surfaced in which trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that when youre a star, they let you do it. you can do anything. ... grab em by the pussy. the incidents widespread media exposure led to trumps first public apology during the campaign and caused outrage across the political spectrum.

trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. he has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the suntil , most of these references cast trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.

albert einstein  was a germanborn theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. best known for developing the theory of relativity, einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. his massenergy equivalence formula e  mc, which arises from relativity theory, has been called the worlds most famous equation. he received the  nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. in a  poll of  leading physicists worldwide by the british journal physics world, einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein broadly synonymous with genius.in , a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis , einstein published four groundbreaking papers. these outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativitya theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic fieldand demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. in , he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. a cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. the middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.

for much of the last phase of his academic life, einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. firstly, he fought a long rearguard action against quantum theorys introduction of fundamental randomness into sciences picture of the world, objecting that god does not play dice. secondly, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too. as a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.

born in the german empire, einstein moved to switzerland in , forsaking his german citizenship  the following year. in , at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich, graduating in . in , he acquired swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. in , he secured a permanent position at the swiss patent office in bern. in , he submitted a successful phd dissertation to the university of zurich. in , he moved to berlin in order to join the prussian academy of sciences and the humboldt university of berlin. in , he became director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics; he also became a german citizen again, this time as a subject of the kingdom of prussia. in , while he was visiting the united states, adolf hitler came to power in germany. horrified by the nazi war of extermination against his fellow jews, einstein decided to remain in the us, and was granted american citizenship in . on the eve of world war ii, he endorsed a letter to president franklin d. roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research. einstein supported the allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.

albert einstein was born in ulm, in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire, on  march . his parents, secular ashkenazi jews, were hermann einstein, a salesman and engineer, and pauline koch. in , the family moved to munich, where einsteins father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik j. einstein  cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich from the age of five. when he was eight, he was transferred to the luitpoldgymnasium  where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.in , hermann and jakobs company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in munich, but without successthey lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative. the failure of their bid forced them to sell their munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. the einstein family moved to italy, first to milan and a few months later to pavia, where they settled in palazzo cornazzani. einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in munich in order to finish his schooling. his father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the gymnasiums regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. he later wrote that the schools policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. at the end of december , a letter from a doctor persuaded the luitpolds authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in pavia. while in italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field.einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. he began teaching himself algebra, calculus and euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday. a family tutor, max talmud, said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old einstein a geometry textbook, the boy had worked through the whole book. he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow. einstein recorded that he had mastered integral and differential calculus while still just fourteen. his love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already confident that nature could be understood as a mathematical structure.

at thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy, einstein was introduced to kants critique of pure reason. kant became his favorite philosopher; according to his tutor, at the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet kants works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.

in , at the age of sixteen, einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school  in zürich, switzerland. he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test, but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics. on the advice of the polytechnics principal, he completed his secondary education at the argovian cantonal school  in aarau, switzerland, graduating in . while lodging in aarau with the family of jost winteler, he fell in love with wintelers daughter, marie. 

in january , with his fathers approval, einstein renounced his citizenship of the german kingdom of württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service. the matura  awarded to him in the september of that year acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a top grade of  for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry. at seventeen, he enrolled in the fouryear mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school. marie winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in olsberg, switzerland.the five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old serbian, mileva marić. over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic schools lectures did not cover. in his letters to marić, einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers.historians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which marić contributed to the insights of einsteins annus mirabilis publications. there is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas, but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all.

correspondence between einstein and marić, discovered and published in , revealed that in early , while marić was visiting her parents in novi sad, she gave birth to a daughter, lieserl. when marić returned to switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. a letter of einsteins that he wrote in september  suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.einstein and marić married in january . in may , their son hans albert was born in bern, switzerland. their son eduard was born in zürich in july . in letters that einstein wrote to marie winteler in the months before eduards arrival, he described his love for his wife as misguided and mourned the missed life that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married winteler instead i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.in , einstein entered into a relationship with elsa löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mothers side and his second cousin on his fathers. when marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to berlin with him in april , she returned to zürich, taking hans albert and eduard with her. einstein and marić were granted a divorce on  february  on the grounds of having lived apart for five years. as part of the divorce settlement, einstein agreed that if he were to win a nobel prize, he would give the money that he received to marić; she had to wait only two years before her foresight in extracting this promise from him was rewarded.einstein married löwenthal in . in , he began a relationship with a secretary named betty neumann, the niece of his close friend hans mühsam. löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him, accompanying him when he emigrated to the united states in . in , she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. she died in december .a volume of einsteins letters released by hebrew university of jerusalem in  added further names to the catalog of women with whom he was romantically involved. they included margarete lebach , estella katzenellenbogen , toni mendel  and ethel michanowski , with whom he spent time and from whom he accepted gifts while married to löwenthal. after being widowed, einstein was briefly in a relationship with margarita konenkova, thought by some to be a russian spy; her husband, the russian sculptor sergei konenkov, created the bronze bust of einstein at the institute for advanced study at princeton.following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, einsteins son eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia. he spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum. after her death, he was committed permanently to burghölzli, the psychiatric university hospital in zürich.

einstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in , duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics. his successful acquisition of swiss citizenship in february  was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription; the swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service. he found that swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one. eventually it was with the help of marcel grossmanns father that he secured a post in bern at the swiss patent office, as an assistant examiner  level iii.patent applications that landed on einsteins desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter. his employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in , although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had fully mastered machine technology. it is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity. he arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment.in , einstein and some friends whom he had met in bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. their choice of a name for their club, the olympia academy, was an ironic comment upon its far from olympian status. sometimes they were joined by marić, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening. the thinkers whose works they reflected upon included henri poincaré, ernst mach and david hume, all of whom significantly influenced einsteins own subsequent ideas and beliefs.

einsteins first paper, folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen , in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal annalen der physik in . his page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics. titled eine neue bestimmung der moleküldimensionen  and dedicated to his friend marcel grossman, it was completed on  april  and approved by professor alfred kleiner of the university of zurich three months later.  four other pieces of work that einstein completed in his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energyhave led to the years being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics almost as wonderful as  . the publications deeply impressed einsteins contemporaries.

einsteins sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in , when he secured a junior teaching position at the university of bern. in , a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the university of zurich, much admired by alfred kleiner, led to zürichs luring him away from bern with a newly created associate professorship. promotion to a full professorship followed in april , when he accepted a chair at the german charlesferdinand university in prague, a move which required him to become an austrian citizen of the austrohungarian empire. his time in prague saw him producing eleven research papers.

 in july , he returned to his alma mater, the eth zurich, to take up a chair in theoretical physics. his teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. in his work on the latter topic, he was assisted by his friend, marcel grossmann, whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own.in the spring of , two german visitors, max planck and walther nernst, called upon einstein in zürich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to berlin. they offered him membership of the prussian academy of sciences, the directorship of the planned kaiser wilhelm institute for physics and a chair at the humboldt university of berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him. their invitation was all the more appealing to him because berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend, elsa löwenthal. he duly joined the academy on 

july , and moved into an apartment in the berlin district of dahlem on  april . he was installed in his humboldt university position shortly thereafter.the outbreak of the first world war in july  marked the beginning of einsteins gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth. when the manifesto of the ninetythree was published in october a document signed by a host of prominent german thinkers that justified germanys belligerenceeinstein was one of the few german intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative, eirenic manifesto to the europeans instead. but this expression of his doubts about german policy did not prevent him from being elected to a twoyear term as president of the german physical society in . and when the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics opened its doors the following yearits foundation delayed because of the wareinstein was appointed its first director, just as planck and nernst had promised.einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in , and a foreign member of the royal society in . in , he was awarded the  nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. at this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity sceptically, and the nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged it did not assent to einsteins notion of the particulate nature of light, which only won over the entire scientific community when s. n. bose derived the planck spectrum in . that same year, einstein was elected an international honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences. britains closest equivalent of the nobel award, the royal societys copley medal, was not hung around einsteins neck until . he was elected an international member of the american philosophical society in .einstein resigned from the prussian academy in march . his accomplishments in berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the einsteinde haas effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of boseeinstein statistics.

in , einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists. in , he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the sun as it passed close to the suns photosphere . he reworked his calculation in , having now found a way to model gravitation with the riemann curvature tensor of a noneuclidean fourdimensional spacetime. by the fall of , his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of mercury . a total eclipse of the sun that took place on  may  provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by sir arthur eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations. eddingtons work was reported at length in newspapers around the world. on  november , for example, the leading british newspaper, the times, printed a banner headline that read revolution in science  new theory of the universe  newtonian ideas overthrown.

with eddingtons eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, einstein became perhaps the worlds first celebrity scientist, a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century.einstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in america, where he arrived on  april . he was welcomed to new york city by mayor john francis hylan, and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions. he spoke several times at columbia university and princeton, and in washington, he visited the white house with representatives of the national academy of sciences. he returned to europe via london, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman viscount haldane. he used his time in the british capital to meet several people prominent in british scientific, political or intellectual life, and to deliver a lecture at kings college. in july , he published an essay, my first impression of the u.s.a., in which he sought to sketch the american character, much as had alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america . he wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms what strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... the american is friendly, selfconfident, optimistic, and without envy.in , einsteins travels were to the old world rather than the new. he devoted six months to a tour of asia that saw him speaking in japan, singapore and sri lanka . after his first public lecture in tokyo, he met emperor yoshihito and his wife at the imperial palace, with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him.  he was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour, in which he spent twelve days in mandatory palestine, newly entrusted to british rule by the league of nations in the aftermath of the first world war. sir herbert samuel, the british high commissioner, welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute. one reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak he told them that he was happy that jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.einsteins decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in  meant that he was unable to go to stockholm in the december of that year to participate in the nobel prize ceremony. his place at the traditional nobel banquet was taken by a german diplomat, who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace. a two week visit to spain that he undertook in  saw him collecting another award, a membership of the spanish academy of sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by king alfonso xiii. 

from  until , with the exception of a few months in  and , einstein was a member of the genevabased international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations, a group set up by the league to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries. he was appointed as a german delegate rather than as a representative of switzerland because of the machinations of two catholic activists, oskar halecki and giuseppe motta. by persuading secretary general eric drummond to deny einstein the place on the committee reserved for a swiss thinker, they created an opening for gonzague de reynold, who used his league of nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional catholic doctrine. einsteins former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the polish chemist marie curie were also members of the committee.

in march and april , einstein and his wife visited south america, where they spent about a week in brazil, a week in uruguay and a month in argentina. their tour was suggested by jorge duclout  and mauricio nirenstein  with the support of several argentine scholars, including julio rey pastor, jakob laub, and leopoldo lugones. and was financed primarily by the council of the university of buenos aires and the asociación hebraica argentina  with a smaller contribution from the argentinegermanic cultural institution.

in december , einstein began another significant sojourn in the united states, drawn back to the us by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the california institute of technology. caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the us in , and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him. but he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested.after arriving in new york city, einstein was taken to various places and events, including chinatown, a lunch with the editors of the new york times, and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. during the days following, he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university, who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind. harry emerson fosdick, pastor at new yorks riverside church, gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a fullsize statue that the church made of einstein, standing at the entrance. also during his stay in new york, he joined a crowd of , people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration.

einstein next traveled to california, where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert a. millikan. his friendship with millikan was awkward, as millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism, where einstein was a pronounced pacifist. during an address to caltechs students, einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. carl laemmle, head of universal studios, gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin. they had an instant rapport, with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife, elsa, to his home for dinner. chaplin said einsteins outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament, from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy.chaplins film, city lights, was to premiere a few days later in hollywood, and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests. walter isaacson, einsteins biographer, described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity. chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis.

in february , while on a visit to the united states, einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor, adolf hitler.while at american universities in early , he undertook his third twomonth visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena. in february and march , the gestapo repeatedly raided his familys apartment in berlin. he and his wife elsa returned to europe in march, and during the trip, they learned that the german reichstag had passed the enabling act on  march, transforming hitlers government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin. later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the nazis and einsteins personal sailboat confiscated. upon landing in antwerp, belgium on  march, einstein immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his german citizenship. the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp.

in april , einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. historian gerald holton describes how, with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues, thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.a month later, einsteins works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings, with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming, jewish intellectualism is dead. one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase, not yet hanged, offering a , bounty on his head. in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born, who had already emigrated from germany to england, einstein wrote, ... i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise. after moving to the us, he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment, and more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence.einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany. aided by the academic assistance council, founded in april  by british liberal politician william beveridge to help academics escape nazi persecution, einstein was able to leave germany. he rented a house in de haan, belgium, where he lived for a few months. in late july , he visited england for about six weeks at the invitation of the british member of parliament commander oliver lockerlampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years. lockerlampson invited him to stay near his cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on roughton heath in the parish of roughton, norfolk. to protect einstein, lockerlampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein was published in the daily herald on  july .lockerlampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home, and later, austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george. einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany. british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist frederick lindemann, to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities. churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out, they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs.einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including turkeys prime minister, i̇smet i̇nönü, to whom he wrote in september  requesting placement of unemployed germanjewish scientists. as a result of einsteins letter, jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over , saved individuals.lockerlampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein, during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe. in one of his speeches he denounced germanys treatment of jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. in his speech he described einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk. both bills failed, however, and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study, in princeton, new jersey, us, to become a resident scholar.

on  october , einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the royal albert hall in london, with the times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout. four days later he returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany. at the time, most american universities, including harvard, princeton and yale, had minimal or no jewish faculty or students, as a result of their jewish quotas, which lasted until the late s.einstein was still undecided on his future. he had offers from several european universities, including christ church, oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between may  and june  and was offered a fiveyear research fellowship , but in , he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship.einsteins affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in . he was one of the four first selected  at the new institute. he soon developed a close friendship with gödel; the two would take long walks together discussing their work. bruria kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. during this period, einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. he lived in princeton at his home from  onwards. the albert einstein house was made a national historic landmark in .

in , a group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research. the groups warnings were discounted. einstein and szilárd, along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner, regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon. to make certain the us was aware of the danger, in july , a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe, szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with szilárd, to president roosevelt, recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the u.s. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the u.s. entry into world war ii. in addition to the letter, einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white houses oval office. some say that as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt, the us entered the race to develop the bomb, drawing on its immense material, financial, and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project.

for einstein, war was a disease ... and he called for resistance to war. by signing the letter to roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. in , a year before his death, einstein said to his old friend, linus pauling, i made one great mistake in my lifewhen i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justificationthe danger that the germans would make them ... in , einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including british philosopher bertrand russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons. in  einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the world academy of art and science , an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons.

einstein became an american citizen in . not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture compared to europe. he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers. as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people  in princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans. he considered racism americas worst disease, seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next. as part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist w. e. b. du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in . when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois, the judge decided to drop the case.in , einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans; alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall. einstein gave a speech about racism in america, adding, i do not intend to be quiet about it. a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. einstein has said, being a jew myself, perhaps i can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination.

in , einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party, a liberal party. later in his life, einsteins political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism. his opinions on the bolsheviks also changed with time. in , he criticized them for not having a wellregulated system of government and called their rule a regime of terror and a tragedy in human history. he later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his  remark on vladimir lenin

in lenin i honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. i do not find his methods advisable. one thing is certain, however men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankinds conscience.

einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nationstates in the framework of a world federation. he wrote i advocate world government because i am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself. the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in ; by the time of his death, it was , pages long.einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi, with whom he corresponded. he described gandhi as a role model for the generations to come. the initial connection was established on  september , when wilfrid israel took his indian guest v. a. sundaram to meet his friend einstein at his summer home in the town of caputh. sundaram was gandhis disciple and special envoy, whom wilfrid israel met while visiting india and visiting the indian leaders home in . during the visit, einstein wrote a short letter to gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. although in the end einstein and gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through wilfrid israel.

einstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the hebrew university of jerusalem, which opened in . earlier, in , he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization, chaim weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. he made suggestions for the creation of an institute of agriculture, a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the countrys development. he also promoted the establishment of an oriental studies institute, to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic.einstein was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent jewish state. he felt that the waves of arriving jews of the aliyah could live alongside existing arabs in palestine. the state of israel was established without his help in ; einstein was limited to a marginal role in the zionist movement. upon the death of israeli president weizmann in november , prime minister david bengurion offered einstein the largely ceremonial position of president of israel at the urging of ezriel carlebach. the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington, abba eban, who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons. einstein wrote that he was deeply moved, but at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it.

einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews. he said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinozas philosophy. he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. he clarified, however, that i am not an atheist, preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a deeply religious nonbeliever. when asked if he believed in an afterlife, einstein replied, no. and one life is enough for me.einstein was primarily affiliated with nonreligious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us. he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york, and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association, which publishes new humanist in britain. for the th anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture, he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. he observed, without ethical culture there is no salvation for humanity.

in a germanlanguage letter to philosopher eric gutkind, dated  january , einstein wrotethe word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. no interpretation no matter how subtle can  change this. ... for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... i cannot see anything chosen about them.

einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. in a letter in  to hermann huth, vicepresident of the german vegetarian federation , he wrotealthough i have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, i have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.

he became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. in march  he wrote in a letter so i am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. it almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.

einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. in his late journals he wrote

if i were not a physicist, i would probably be a musician. i often think in music. i live my daydreams in music. i see my life in terms of music ... i get most joy in life out of music.

his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture. according to conductor leon botstein, einstein began playing when he was . however, he did not enjoy it at that age.when he turned , he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart, whereupon he became enamored of mozarts compositions and studied music more willingly. einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically. he said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty. at the age of , he was heard by a school examiner in aarau while playing beethovens violin sonatas. the examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight. what struck the examiner, writes botstein, was that einstein displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einsteins life from that period on. although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including kurt appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern, zürich, and berlin, where he played with max planck and his son, among others. he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the  edition of the köchel catalog of mozarts work; that edition was prepared by alfred einstein, who may have been a distant relation.in , while engaged in research at the california institute of technology, he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles, where he played some of beethoven and mozarts works with members of the zoellner quartet. near the end of his life, when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was impressed by einsteins level of coordination and intonation.

on  april , einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in . he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.einstein refused surgery, saying, i want to go when i want. it is tasteless to prolong life artificially. i have done my share; it is time to go. i will do it elegantly. he died in the university medical center of princeton at plainsboro early the next morning at the age of , having continued to work until near the end.during the autopsy, the pathologist thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent. einsteins remains were cremated in trenton, new jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.in a memorial lecture delivered on  december  at unesco headquarters, nuclear physicist j. robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the hebrew university of jerusalem in israel.

throughout his life, einstein published hundreds of books and articles. he published more than  scientific papers and  nonscientific ones. on  december , universities and archives announced the release of einsteins papers, comprising more than , unique documents. einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius. in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the boseeinstein statistics, the einstein refrigerator and others.there is some evidence from einsteins writings that he collaborated with his first wife, mileva marić. in  december , a first article on capillarity signed only under his name was submitted. the decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.

the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect , brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and e  mc that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in . these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. the four papers are

einsteins first paper submitted in  to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction. it was published in  with the title folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen, which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena. two papers he published in   attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. these papers were the foundation for the  paper on brownian motion, which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. his research in  and  was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.

einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. at the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

einsteins zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper  was received on  june  and published  september of that same year. it reconciled conflicts between maxwells equations  and the laws of newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds . the theory developed in this paper later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity.

this paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aetherone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timewas superfluous.in his paper on massenergy equivalence, einstein produced e  mc as a consequence of his special relativity equations. einsteins  work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with max planck.einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics . in , hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. einstein adopted minkowskis formalism in his  general theory of relativity.

general relativity  is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between  and . according to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses. general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.as einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion  should appear more satisfactory. consequently, in  he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. this argument is called the equivalence principle. in the same article, einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing.in , einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the  article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.

in , einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. by contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

the first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, psr b. the explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. einsteins prediction was confirmed on  february , when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on earth on  september , nearly one hundred years after the prediction.

while developing general relativity, einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.in june , the entwurf  theory was the result of these investigations. as its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. after more than two years of intensive work, einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november .

in , einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with einsteins understanding of machs principle in these years. this model became known as the einstein world or einsteins static universe.following the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by edwin hubble in , einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the friedmanneinstein universe of  and the einsteinde sitter universe of . in each of these models, einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory.in many einstein biographies, it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder, based on a letter george gamow claimed to have received from him. the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim.in late , a team led by the irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of hubbles observations of the recession of the galaxies, einstein considered a steadystate model of the universe. in a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early , einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that he associated with the cosmological constant. as he stated in the paper, in what follows, i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation  that can account for hubbels sic facts, and in which the density is constant over time ... if one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. for the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.

it thus appears that einstein considered a steadystate model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle, bondi and gold. however, einsteins steadystate model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.

general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. he maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. while the use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by erwin schrödinger and others, einsteins approach has been echoed by physicists including lev landau and evgeny lifshitz.

in , einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called einsteinrosen bridges. his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles. these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, einstein and rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. however, it was later found that einsteinrosen bridges are not stable.

in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the s.

in general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. a curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straightline path, but rather the bodys attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. a remark by john archibald wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. the einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. the geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. einstein regarded this as an independent fundamental assumption that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves. since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. accordingly, einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed.

in a  paper, einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles . einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including max planck and niels bohr. this idea only became universally accepted in , with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of compton scattering.

einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is plancks constant. he did not say much more, because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave. but he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.

in , einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. in the einstein model, each atom oscillates independentlya series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. peter debye refined this model.

in , einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift für physik. einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the boseeinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. it was not until  that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultracooling equipment built at the nistjila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder. boseeinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university.

although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in , he had not given up on academia. in , he became a privatdozent at the university of bern. in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung , on the quantization of light, and in an earlier  paper, einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have welldefined momenta and act in some respects as independent, pointlike particles. this paper introduced the photon concept  and inspired the notion of waveparticle duality in quantum mechanics. einstein saw this waveparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

in a series of works completed from  to , planck reformulated his  quantum theory and introduced the idea of zeropoint energy in his second quantum theory. soon, this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern. assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zeropoint energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. the numbers matched nicely. however, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zeropoint energy.

in , at the height of his work on relativity, einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.

this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. in another major paper from this era, einstein observed that de broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of bohr and sommerfeld. this paper would inspire schrödingers work of .

einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his  paper on the photoelectric effect. however, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after , despite its acceptance by other physicists. he was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that god is not playing at dice. until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.

 the bohreinstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr, who were two of its founders. their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.

einstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics. while he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with bohr in . einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. the quantummechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction. if the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction. but because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. because the true physical condition of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.a more famous version of this argument came in , when einstein published a paper with boris podolsky and nathan rosen that laid out what would become known as the epr paradox. in this thought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled. then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other particle. likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. they argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the theory of relativity. they invoked a principle, later known as the epr criterion of reality, positing that if, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty  the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity. from this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. but quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system. einstein, podolsky, and rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.in , john stewart bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. he deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. this constraint would later be called a bell inequality. bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal, which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated. bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the epr paradox is resolved in the way which einstein would have liked least.despite this, and although einstein personally found the argument in the epr paper overly complicated, that paper became among the most influential papers published in physical review. it is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.

encouraged by his success with general relativity, einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. in , he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation. his attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death. although most researchers now believe that einsteins approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire.

einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. these pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.

in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld, nathan rosen, peter bergmann and others, einstein also had some oneshot collaborations with various scientists.

in , owen willans richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate. this effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials. einstein and wander johannes de haas published two papers in  claiming the first experimental observation of the effect. measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment  of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. these measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons.

in , einstein and his former student leó szilárd coinvented  the einstein refrigerator. this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. on  november , u.s. patent ,, was awarded to einstein and leó szilárd for the refrigerator. their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux.einstein also invented an electromagnetic pump, sound reproduction device, and several other household devices.

while traveling, einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse. the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem. margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death . barbara wolff, of the hebrew universitys albert einstein archives, told the bbc that there are about , pages of private correspondence written between  and .einsteins right of publicity was litigated in  in a federal district court in california. although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. the underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. the right is enforceable, and the hebrew university of jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. corbis, successor to the roger richman agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.mount einstein in the chugach mountains of alaska was named in .

mount einstein in new zealands paparoa range was named after him in  by the department of scientific and industrial research.

einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in . although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired. in the period before world war ii, the new yorker published a vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory. eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else pardon me, sorry always i am mistaken for professor einstein.einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. he is a favorite model for depictions of absentminded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. time magazines frederic golden wrote that einstein was a cartoonists dream come true.many popular quotations are often misattributed to him. for example, it is often claimed, erroneously, that he said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in , he was awarded the  nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. none of the nominations in  met the criteria set by alfred nobel, so the  prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in .einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.

in  ad, britannia referred to the roman province that encompassed modern england and wales. great britain encompassed the whole island, taking in the land north of the river forth known to the romans as caledonia in modern scotland . in the middle ages, the name britain was also applied to a small part of france now known as brittany. as a result, great britain  came into use to refer specifically to the island, with brittany often referred to as little britain. however, that name had no official significance until , when the islands kingdoms of england and scotland were united as the kingdom of great britain.the acts of union  declared that the kingdom of england and kingdom of scotland were united into one kingdom by the name of great britain. the term united kingdom has occasionally been used as a description for the former kingdom of great britain, although its official name from  to  was simply great britain. the acts of union  united the kingdoms of great britain and ireland in , forming the united kingdom of great britain and ireland. following the partition of ireland and the independence of the irish free state in , which left northern ireland as the only part of the island of ireland within the united kingdom, the name was changed in  to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland.although the united kingdom is a sovereign country, england, scotland, wales and northern ireland are also widely referred to as countries. the uk prime ministers website has used the phrase countries within a country to describe the united kingdom. some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve nuts  regions refer to scotland, wales and northern ireland as regions. northern ireland is also referred to as a province. with regard to northern ireland, the descriptive name used can be controversial, with the choice often revealing ones political preferences.the term great britain conventionally refers to the island of great britain, or politically to england, scotland and wales in combination. it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the united kingdom as a whole. the word england is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the united kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the uk.the term britain is used as a synonym for great britain, and the united kingdom. usage is mixed the uk government prefers to use the term uk rather than britain or british on its website , while acknowledging that both terms refer to the united kingdom and that elsewhere british government is used at least as frequently as united kingdom government. the uk permanent committee on geographical names recognises united kingdom, uk and u.k. as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list britain but notes that it is only the one specific nominal term great britain which invariably excludes northern ireland. the bbc historically preferred to use britain as shorthand only for great britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that great britain excludes northern ireland.the adjective british is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the united kingdom and is used in law to refer to united kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality. people of the united kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being british, english, scottish, welsh, northern irish, or irish; or as having a combination of different national identities. the official designation for a citizen of the united kingdom is british citizen.

settlement by cromagnons of what was to become the united kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about , years ago. by the end of the regions prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed insular celtic, comprising brittonic britain and gaelic ireland.

the roman conquest, beginning in  ad, and the year rule of southern britain, was followed by an invasion by germanic anglosaxon settlers, reducing the brittonic area mainly to what was to become wales, cornwall and, until the latter stages of the anglosaxon settlement, the hen ogledd . most of the region settled by the anglosaxons became unified as the kingdom of england in the th century. meanwhile, gaelicspeakers in northwest britain  united with the picts to create the kingdom of scotland in the th century.

in , the normans invaded england from northern france. after conquering england, they seized large parts of wales, conquered much of ireland and were invited to settle in scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the northern french model and normanfrench culture. the anglonorman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures. subsequent medieval english kings completed the conquest of wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex scotland. asserting its independence in the  declaration of arbroath, scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in nearconstant conflict with england.

the english monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in france and claims to the french crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in france, most notably the hundred years war, while the kings of scots were in an alliance with the french during this period.early modern britain saw religious conflict resulting from the reformation and the introduction of protestant state churches in each country. the english reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the th century and established the church of england. moreover, it defined a national identity for england and slowly, but profoundly, changed peoples religious beliefs. wales was fully incorporated into the kingdom of england, and ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the english crown. in what was to become northern ireland, the lands of the independent catholic gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to protestant settlers from england and scotland.in , the kingdoms of england, scotland and ireland were united in a personal union when james vi, king of scots, inherited the crowns of england and ireland and moved his court from edinburgh to london; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.in the midth century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars  which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of king charles i, and the establishment of the shortlived unitary republic of the commonwealth of england, scotland and ireland.although the monarchy was restored, the interregnum along with the glorious revolution of  and the subsequent bill of rights  in england and claim of right act  in scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed catholic could never accede to the throne. the british constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system. with the founding of the royal society in , science was greatly encouraged. during this period, particularly in england, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in north america and the caribbean.though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within great britain in , , and  had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in  led to the treaty of union of  being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

on  may , the kingdom of great britain was formed, the result of the acts of union .in the th century, cabinet government developed under robert walpole, in practice the first prime minister . a series of jacobite uprisings sought to remove the protestant house of hanover from the throne and restore the catholic house of stuart. the jacobites were finally defeated at the battle of culloden in , after which the scottish highlanders were forcibly assimilated into scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. the british colonies in north america that broke away in the american war of independence became the united states, recognised by britain in . british imperial ambition turned towards asia, particularly to india.britain played a leading part in the atlantic slave trade, mainly between  and  when british or britishcolonial slave ships transported nearly . million slaves from africa. the slaves were taken to work on plantations, principally in the caribbean but also north america. slavery coupled with the caribbean sugar industry had a significant role in strengthening the british economy in the th century. however, with pressure from the abolitionism movement, parliament banned the trade in , banned slavery in the british empire in , and britain took a role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

in  the parliaments of great britain and ireland each passed an act of union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland.

after the defeat of france at the end of the french revolutionary wars and napoleonic wars , the united kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power . unchallenged at sea, british dominance was later described as pax britannica , a period of relative peace among the great powers  during which the british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. by the time of the great exhibition of , britain was described as the workshop of the world. from  to , britain took part in the crimean war, allied with the ottoman empire against tsarist russia, participating in the naval battles of the baltic sea known as the åland war in the gulf of bothnia and the gulf of finland, among others. following the indian rebellion in , the british government led by lord palmerston assumed direct rule over india. alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as east asia and latin america.

throughout the victorian era, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissezfaire policies, as well as a gradual widening of the voting franchise, with the  reform act championed by william gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. the british population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. by the late th century, the conservatives under benjamin disraeli and lord salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in africa, maintained a policy of splendid isolation in europe, and attempted to contain russian influence in afghanistan and persia, in what came to be known as the great game. during this time, canada, australia and new zealand were granted selfgoverning dominion status. at the turn of the century, britains industrial dominance became challenged by the german empire and the united states. the edwardian era saw social reform and home rule for ireland become important domestic issues, while the labour party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in , and suffragettes campaigned for womens right to vote.

britain was one of the principal allies that defeated the central powers in the first world war . alongside their french, russian and  american counterparts, british armed forces were engaged across much of the british empire and in several regions of europe, particularly on the western front. the high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. britain had suffered . million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. the consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections with the representation of the people act . after the war, britain became a permanent member of the executive council of the league of nations and received a mandate over a number of former german and ottoman colonies. under the leadership of david lloyd george, the british empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the worlds land surface and a quarter of its population.by the mids, most of the british population could listen to bbc radio programmes. experimental television broadcasts began in  and the first scheduled bbc television service commenced in . the rise of irish nationalism, and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in . the irish free state became independent, initially with dominion status in , and unambiguously independent in . northern ireland remained part of the united kingdom. the  equal franchise act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. strikes in the mids culminated in the general strike of , which ended in a victory for the government led by stanley baldwin. britain had still not recovered from the effects of the first world war when the great depression  led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. a coalition government was formed in .

nonetheless, britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system. after nazi germany invaded poland in , britain entered the second world war. winston churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in . despite the defeat of its european allies in the first year, britain and its empire continued the war against germany. churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.in , the royal air force defeated the german luftwaffe in the battle of britain. urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the blitz. the grand alliance of britain, the united states and the soviet union formed in , leading the allies against the axis powers. there were eventual hardfought victories in the battle of the atlantic, the north africa campaign and the italian campaign. british forces played important roles in the normandy landings of  and the liberation of europe. the british army led the burma campaign against japan, and the british pacific fleet fought japan at sea. british scientists contributed to the manhattan project whose task was to build an atomic weapon. once built, it was decided, with british consent, to use the weapon against japan.

the uk was one of the big three powers  who met to plan the postwar world; it was an original signatory to the declaration by united nations and became one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council. it worked closely with the united states to establish the imf, world bank and nato. the war left the uk severely weakened and financially dependent on the marshall plan, but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern europe.in the immediate postwar years, the labour government under clement attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly impacted british society in the following decades. major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the national health service, was created. the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britains muchdiminished economic position, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. independence was granted to india and pakistan in . over the next three decades, most colonies of the british empire gained their independence, and many became members of the commonwealth of nations.

the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal , but the postwar limits of britains international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of . the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture. as a result of a shortage of workers in the s, the government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries. in the following decades, the uk became a more multiethnic society. despite rising living standards in the late s and s, the uks economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as france, west germany and japan.

in the decadeslong process of european integration, the uk was a founding member of the western european union, established with the london and paris conferences in . in  the uk was one of the seven founding members of the european free trade association , but in  it left to join the european communities . in a  referendum  voted to stay in it. when the ec became the european union  in , the uk was one of the  founding member states.

from the late s, northern ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence  conventionally known as the troubles. it is usually considered to have ended with the  belfast good friday agreement.

following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the s, the conservative government of the s led by margaret thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector  and labour markets, the sale of stateowned companies , and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.in , argentina invaded the british territories of south georgia and the falkland islands, leading to the week falklands war in which argentine forces were defeated. the inhabitants of the islands are predominantly descendants of british settlers, and strongly favour british sovereignty, expressed in a  referendum. from , the uk economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues.around the end of the th century, there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland, wales and northern ireland. the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights. the uk remained a great power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the united nations and nato.

the uk broadly supported the united states approach to the war on terror in the early st century. british troops fought in the war in afghanistan, but controversy surrounded britains military deployment in iraq, which saw the largest protest in british history demonstrating in opposition to the government led by tony blair.the  global financial crisis severely affected the uk economy. the cameronclegg coalition government of  introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits. studies have suggested that policy led to significant social disruption and suffering. a referendum on scottish independence in  resulted in the scottish electorate voting by . to . to remain part of the united kingdom.in , . per cent of voters in the united kingdom voted to leave the european union. the uk left the eu in . on  may  the euuk trade and cooperation agreement came into force.the covid pandemic had a severe impact on the uks economy, caused major disruptions to education and had farreaching impacts on society and politics in  and . the united kingdom was the first country in the world to use an approved covid vaccine, developing its own vaccine through a collaboration between oxford university and astrazeneca, which allowed the uks vaccine rollout to be among the fastest in the world.on  september , elizabeth ii, the longestliving and longestreigning british monarch, died at the age of . upon the queens death, her eldest child charles, prince of wales, acceded to the british throne as charles iii.

the total area of the united kingdom is approximately , square kilometres . the country occupies the major part of the british isles archipelago and includes the island of great britain, the northeastern onesixth of the island of ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. it lies between the north atlantic ocean and the north sea with the southeast coast coming within  miles  of the coast of northern france, from which it is separated by the english channel.the royal greenwich observatory in london was chosen as the defining point of the prime meridian at the international meridian conference in .the united kingdom lies between latitudes  and  n, and longitudes  w and  e. northern ireland shares a mile  land boundary with the republic of ireland. the coastline of great britain is , miles  long. it is connected to continental europe by the channel tunnel, which at  miles   is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.the uk contains four terrestrial ecoregions celtic broadleaf forests, english lowlands beech forests, north atlantic moist mixed forests, and caledon conifer forests. the area of woodland in the uk in  is estimated to be . million hectares, which represents  of the total land area in the uk.

most of the united kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. the temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below  c  or rising above  c . some parts, away from the coast, of upland england, wales, northern ireland and most of scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate . higher elevations in scotland experience a continental subarctic climate  and the mountains experience a tundra climate .the prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the atlantic ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. atlantic currents, warmed by the gulf stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. summers are warmest in the southeast of england and coolest in the north. heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.the average total annual sunshine in the united kingdom is . hours, which is just under  of the maximum possible. the hours of sunshine vary from  to about  hours per year, and since  the uk has been and still is receiving above the  to  average hours of sunshine.as of , the united kingdom is ranked nd out of  countries in the environmental performance index. a law has been passed that uk greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by .

england accounts for  per cent of the uk, covering , square miles . most of the country consists of lowland terrain, with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the teesexe line which roughly divides the uk into lowland and upland areas. lowland areas include cornwall, the new forest, the south downs and the norfolk broads. upland areas include the lake district, the pennines, the yorkshire dales, exmoor, and dartmoor. the main rivers and estuaries are the thames, severn, and the humber. englands highest mountain is scafell pike, at  metres  in the lake district; its largest island is the isle of wight.

scotland accounts for  per cent of the uk, covering , square miles . this includes nearly  islands, notably the hebrides, orkney islands and shetland islands. scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the uk, the highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of scotlands mountainous land, including the cairngorms, loch lomond and the trossachs and ben nevis which at , metres  is the highest point in the british isles.wales accounts for less than  per cent of the uk, covering , square miles . wales is mostly mountainous, though south wales is less mountainous than north and mid wales. the highest mountains in wales are in snowdonia and include snowdon  which, at , metres , is the highest peak in wales. wales has over , miles  of coastline including the pembrokeshire coast. several islands lie off the welsh mainland, the largest of which is anglesey .

northern ireland, separated from great britain by the irish sea and north channel, has an area of , square miles  and is mostly hilly. it includes lough neagh which, at  square miles , is the largest lake in the british isles by area, lough erne which has over  islands and the giants causeway which is a world heritage site. the highest peak in northern ireland is slieve donard in the mourne mountains at  metres .

the uk is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the westminster system, otherwise known as a democratic parliamentary monarchy. it is a centralised, unitary state wherein the parliament of the united kingdom is sovereign. parliament is made up of the elected house of commons, the appointed house of lords and the crown . the main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament . as a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the british constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judgemade case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions. nevertheless, the supreme court recognises a number of principles underlying the british constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law.king charles iii is the current monarch and head of state of the uk and of  other independent countries. these  countries are today referred to as commonwealth realms. the monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the crown and is ...fundamental to the law and working of government in the uk. the disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative, is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the crown responsible to parliament and thence to the electorate. nevertheless, in the performance of official duties, the monarch has the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. in addition, the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.

for general elections , the uk is currently divided into  constituencies, each of which is represented by one member of parliament  elected by the firstpastthepost system. mps hold office for up to five years and must then stand for reelection if they wish to continue to be an mp. the conservative party, colloquially known as the tory party or the tories, and the labour party have been the dominant political parties in the uk since the s, leading to the uk being described as a twoparty system. however, since the s other political parties have won seats in the house of commons, although never more than the conservatives or labour.the prime minister is the head of government in the uk. acting under the direction and supervision of a cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, the government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the privy council, promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch.

nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as first lord of the treasury and all prime ministers have continuously served as first lord of the treasury since , minister for the civil service since , and minister for the union since . while appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention, an mp, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the house of commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the house of commons. the current prime minister, as of october , is rishi sunak mp, leader of the conservative party.

the geographical division of the united kingdom into counties or shires began in england and scotland in the early middle ages, and was completed throughout great britain and ireland by the early modern period. modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate acts of parliament in england and wales in , scotland in  and ireland in , meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the uk.

until the th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.local government in england is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. the uppertier subdivisions of england are the nine regions, now used primarily for statistical purposes. one of the regions, greater london, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since  following popular support for the proposal in a  referendum.local government in scotland is divided into  council areas with a wide variation in size and population. the cities of glasgow, edinburgh, aberdeen and dundee are separate council areas, as is the highland council, which includes a third of scotlands area but only just over , people. local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are ,.local government in wales consists of  unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. these include the cities of cardiff, swansea and newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right. elections are held every four years under the firstpastthepost system.local government in northern ireland since , has been organised into  district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries. in  the executive agreed on proposals to create  new councils and replace the present system.

since , scotland has had a devolved national government and legislature called the scottish parliament. the scottish government and parliament have wideranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament, including education, healthcare, scots law and local government. their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the uk parliament passed in . the current scottish government is a scottish national party and scottish greens coalition, led by first minister humza yousaf, leader of the scottish national party. in , the scottish independence referendum was held, with . voting against independence from the united kingdom and . voting in favour, resulting in scotland staying within the united kingdom. local government in scotland is divided into  council areas with a wide variation in size and population. local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are ,.

since , wales has a devolved national government and legislature, known as the senedd. elections to the senedd use the additional member system. they have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland. the senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the uk parliament through acts of senedd cymru. the current welsh government is labour, led by first minister mark drakeford, who has been the first minister since . local government in wales consists of  unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.

since , northern ireland has a devolved government, the executive, and legislature, the assembly. elections to the assembly use the single transferable vote system. the executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland. the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly. the island of ireland has a turbulent and violent modern political history, a period referred to as the troubles. the  good friday agreement acts as a de facto constitution for northern ireland. local government in northern ireland since  has been divided between  councils with limited responsibilities.

the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland, wales or northern ireland. under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the uk parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the scottish parliament, senedd or northern ireland assembly. in practice, it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the senedd, because these institutions were created by referendum decisions. the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are greater still, because devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland. the uk parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments legislative competence in economic areas through an act passed in .

the uk is a permanent member of the united nations security council, a member of nato, aukus, the commonwealth of nations, the g finance ministers, the g forum, the g, the oecd, the wto, the council of europe and the osce. the uk has the british council which is a british organisation based in over  countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. the uk is said to have a special relationship with the united states and a close partnership with france  the entente cordiale  and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; the angloportuguese alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. the uk is also closely linked with the republic of ireland; the two countries share a common travel area and cooperate through the britishirish intergovernmental conference and the britishirish council. britains global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements. canada, australia and new zealand, all of which are former colonies of the british empire which share king charles as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by british people.

the united kingdom, the  british overseas territories and the three crown dependencies form one undivided realm. all parts of the realm are under the sovereignty of the british crown, but the territories and dependencies are not part of the uk. this is distinct from the status of commonwealth realms, who have separate monarchies, but share the same monarch.

the  british overseas territories are remnants of the british empire anguilla; bermuda; the british antarctic territory; the british indian ocean territory; the british virgin islands; the cayman islands; the falkland islands; gibraltar; montserrat; saint helena, ascension and tristan da cunha; the turks and caicos islands; the pitcairn islands; south georgia and the south sandwich islands; and akrotiri and dhekelia on the island of cyprus. british claims in antarctica have limited international recognition. collectively britains overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of , square nautical miles , with a total population of approximately ,. the overseas territories also give the uk the worlds fifth largest exclusive economic zone at ,, km .the crown dependencies are possessions of the crown, as opposed to territories of the uk. they comprise three independently administered jurisdictions the bailiwicks of jersey and of guernsey in the english channel, and the isle of man in the irish sea. by mutual agreement, the british government manages the islands foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. internationally, they are regarded as territories for which the united kingdom is responsible. the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the crown . since , each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government.

the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article  of the  treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotlands separate legal system. today the uk has three distinct systems of law english law, northern ireland law and scots law. a new supreme court of the united kingdom came into being in october  to replace the appellate committee of the house of lords. the judicial committee of the privy council, including the same members as the supreme court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries, the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies.both english law, which applies in england and wales, and northern ireland law are based on commonlaw principles. the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales, consisting of the court of appeal, the high court of justice  and the crown court . scots law is a hybrid system based on commonlaw and civillaw principles. the chief courts are the court of session, for civil cases, and the high court of justiciary, for criminal cases. the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law.crime in england and wales increased in the period between  and , though since that peak there has been an overall fall of  per cent in recorded crime from  to , according to crime statistics. the prison population of england and wales has increased to ,, giving england and wales the highest rate of incarceration in western europe at  per ,.samesex marriage has been legal in england, scotland, and wales since , and in northern ireland since . lgbt equality in the united kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.

the congressional budget office  and a broad range of economists credit obamas stimulus plan for economic growth. the cbo released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by . million, while conceding that it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package. although an april , survey of members of the national association for business economics showed an increase in job creation  for the first time in two years,  percent of  respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. the economy of the united states has grown faster than the other original nato members by a wider margin under president obama than it has anytime since the end of world war ii. the organisation for economic cooperation and development credits the much faster growth in the united states to the stimulus plan of the u.s. and the austerity measures in the european union.within a month of the  midterm elections, obama announced a compromise deal with the congressional republican leadership that included a temporary, twoyear extension of the  and  income tax rates, a oneyear payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. the compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting  billion  tax relief, unemployment insurance reauthorization, and job creation act of  passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress before obama signed it on december , .in december , obama declared that growing income inequality is a defining challenge of our time and called on congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. this came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fastfood workers and pope francis criticism of inequality and trickledown economics. obama urged congress to ratify a nation free trade pact called the transpacific partnership.

on april , , an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. obama visited the gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by secretary of the interior ken salazar and concurrent congressional hearings. he then announced a sixmonth moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. as multiple efforts by bp failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by obama and the federal government. prior to the oil spill, on march , , obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the east coast of the united states and along the coast of northern alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.in july , obama expressed reservations and said he would reject the keystone xl pipeline if it increased carbon pollution or greenhouse emissions. on february , , obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. it was the third veto of obamas presidency and his first major veto.in december , obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most united statesowned waters in the atlantic and arctic oceans using the  outer continental shelf act.obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. he used his power under the antiquities act to create  new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of ,, acres  of federal lands and waters, more than any other u.s. president.

obama called for congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the united states, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. he proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. his proposal was to spend  billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. it would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for preexisting conditions, and require every american to carry health coverage. the plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.

on july , , house democratic leaders introduced a ,page plan for overhauling the u.s. health care system, which obama wanted congress to approve by the end of . after public debate during the congressional summer recess of , obama delivered a speech to a joint session of congress on september  where he addressed concerns over the proposals. in march , obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.on november , , a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the house. on december , , the senate passed its own billwithout a public optionon a partyline vote of . on march , , the patient protection and affordable care act  passed by the senate in december was passed in the house by a vote of  to . obama signed the bill into law on march , .the aca includes healthrelated provisions, most of which took effect in , including expanding medicaid eligibility for people making up to  percent of the federal poverty level  starting in , subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to  percent of the fpl  so their maximum outofpocket payment for annual premiums will be from  percent to . percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on preexisting conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. according to white house and cbo figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.

the costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and costsaving measures, such as new medicare taxes for those in highincome brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the medicare advantage program in favor of traditional medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. in march , the cbo estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by  billion over the first decade.the law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. on june , , the supreme court ruled by a  vote in national federation of independent business v. sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the u.s. congresss taxing authority. in burwell v. hobby lobby the court ruled that closelyheld forprofit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the religious freedom restoration act from regulations adopted under the aca that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. in june , the court ruled  in king v. burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans established by the state, as the statute reads.

in his election campaign, obama called the war in iraq a dangerous distraction and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in afghanistan, the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the united states could be launched again. early in his presidency, obama moved to bolster u.s. troop strength in afghanistan. he announced an increase in u.s. troop levels to , military personnel in february  to stabilize a deteriorating situation in afghanistan, an area he said had not received the strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires. he replaced the military commander in afghanistan, general david d. mckiernan, with former special forces commander lt. gen. stanley a. mcchrystal in may , indicating that mcchrystals special forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. on december , , obama announced the deployment of an additional , military personnel to afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals  months from that date; this took place in july . david petraeus replaced mcchrystal in june , after mcchrystals staff criticized white house personnel in a magazine article. in february , obama said the u.s. military would reduce the troop level in afghanistan from , to , u.s. troops by february . in october , the white house announced a plan to keep u.s. forces in afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.regarding neighboring pakistan, obama called its tribal border region the greatest threat to the security of afghanistan and americans, saying that he cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary. in the same speech, obama claimed that the u.s. cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy.

obamas family history, upbringing, and ivy league education differ markedly from those of africanamerican politicians who launched their careers in the s through participation in the civil rights movement. expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is black enough, obama told an august  meeting of the national association of black journalists that were still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong. obama acknowledged his youthful image in an october  campaign speech, saying i wouldnt be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation. additionally, obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator. during his preinauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, obama delivered a series of weekly internet video addresses.

historian julian zelizer credits obama with a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals. zelizer notes obamas policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the great recession and the doddfrank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the affordable care act. zelizer also notes the democratic party lost power and numbers of elected officials during obamas term, saying that the consensus among historians is that obama turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder. zelizer calls this the defining paradox of obamas presidency.the brookings institution noted that obama passed only one major legislative achievement and a fragile one at thatthe legacy of obamas presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions. david w. wise noted that obama fell short in areas many progressives hold dear, including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the great recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for obamacare. wise called obamas legacy that of a disappointingly conventional president.obamas most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the affordable care act , provisions of which went into effect from  to . many attempts by senate republicans to repeal the aca, including a skinny repeal, have thus far failed. however, in , the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective . together with the health care and education reconciliation act amendment, it represents the u.s. healthcare systems most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of medicare and medicaid in .many commentators credit obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the great recession. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the obama administration created . million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term. in , obama signed into effect the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act. passed as a response to the financial crisis of , it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the united states since the regulatory reform that followed the great depression under democratic president franklin d. roosevelt.in , obama signed into law the national defense authorization act for fiscal year , which contained in it the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the united states since democratic president bill clinton signed into law the church arson prevention act of . the act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the united states, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.as president, obama advanced lgbt rights. in , he signed the dont ask, dont tell repeal act, which brought an end to dont ask, dont tell policy in the u.s. armed forces that banned open service from lgb people; the law went into effect the following year. in , his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the u.s. armed forces. a gallup poll, taken in the final days of obamas term, showed that  percent of americans believed the u.s. had made progress on lgbt rights during obamas eight years in office.obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with alqaeda and the taliban. in , the last year of his presidency, the u.s. dropped , bombs on seven different countries. obama left about , u.s. troops in afghanistan, , in iraq,  in syria,  in pakistan,  in somalia, seven in yemen, and two in libya at the end of his presidency.according to pew research center and united states bureau of justice statistics, from december , , to december , , inmates sentenced in u.s. federal custody declined by five percent. this is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in u.s. federal custody since democratic president jimmy carter. by contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents ronald reagan, george h. w. bush, bill clinton, and george w. bush.human rights watch  called obamas human rights record mixed, adding that he has often treated human rights as a secondary interestnice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.obama left office in january  with a  percent approval rating. he gained  spots from the same survey in  from the brookings institution that ranked him the thgreatest american president. in gallups  job approval poll for the past  u.s. presidents, he received a  percent approval rating.

death is the irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. for organisms with a brain, death can also be defined as the irreversible cessation of functioning of the whole brain, including the brainstem.  brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death. the remains of a former organism normally begins to decompose shortly after death. death is an inevitable process that eventually occurs in all organisms. some organisms, such as turritopsis dohrnii, are biologically immortal. however, they can still die from means other than aging.determining when someone has definitively died has proven difficult. initially, death was defined as occurring when breathing and the heartbeat ceased, a status still known as clinical death. however, the development of cpr no longer means it was irreversible. brain death was the next option, but several definitions exist for this. some people believe that all brain functions must cease. some believe that even if the brainstem is still alive, the personality and identity are irretrievably lost, so therefore, the person should be entirely dead.death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis. something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die, as a virus is not considered alive in the first place. as of the early st century,  million people die per year. the most common reason is cardiovascular disease, which is a disease that affects the heart.many cultures and religions have a concept of an afterlife that may hold the idea of judgment of good and bad deeds in ones life. there are also  different customs for honoring the body, such as a funeral, cremation, or sky burial.a study known as biogerontology seeks to eliminate death by natural aging in humans, often through the application of natural processes found in certain organisms. however, as humans do not have the means to apply this to themselves, they have to use other ways to reach the maximum lifespan for a human, such as calorie reduction, dieting, and exercise.as of , a total of  billion humans have died, or roughly . of all humans to ever live.

the concept of death is the key to human understanding of the phenomenon. there are many scientific approaches and various interpretations of the concept. additionally, the advent of lifesustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.

one of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. as a point in time, death seems to refer to the moment when life ends. determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. such determination, therefore, requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. this is difficult due to there being little consensus on how to define life.

it is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. when consciousness ceases, an organism can be said to have died. one of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms that are alive but probably not conscious. another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. additionally, many religious traditions, including abrahamic and dharmic traditions, hold that death does not  entail the end of consciousness. in certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. it implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of organismic functioning and human death, which refers to irreversible loss of personhood. more specifically, death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning. as it pertains to human life, death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person.

historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a humans death have been subjective or imprecise. death was defined as the cessation of heartbeat  and breathing, but the development of cpr and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. this type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death . proponents of the cdd believe this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead. critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is irreversible because if cpr is applied fast enough, the person could be revived. thus, the arguments for and against the cdd boil down to defining the actual words permanent and irreversible, which further complicates the challenge of defining death. furthermore, events causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants, and artificial pacemakers.

today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to brain death or biological death to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. it is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness. suspension of consciousness must be permanent and not transient, as occurs during certain sleep stages, and especially a coma. in the case of sleep, electroencephalogram  are used to tell the difference.the category of brain death is seen as problematic by some scholars. for instance, dr. franklin miller, a senior faculty member at the department of bioethics, national institutes of health, notes by the late s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. these patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses .

while brain death is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. the reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible. also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. the distinction should be made that brain death cannot be equated with one in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.eegs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity temporarily; because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving eegs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

people maintaining that only the neocortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. eventually, the criterion for death may be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex. all hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone, given current and foreseeable medical technology. even by wholebrain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated.

at present, in most places, the more conservative definition of death has been adopted. one example is the uniform determination of death act in the united states. in the past, the adoption of this wholebrain definition was a conclusion of the presidents commission for the study of ethical problems in medicine and biomedical and behavioral research in . they concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. a multitude of reasons was presented to support this definition, including uniformity of standards in law for establishing death, consumption of a familys fiscal resources for artificial life support, and legal establishment for equating brain death with death to proceed with organ donation.

aside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition the variability of its application in medical practice. in , the american academy of neurology  established the criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. at that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied to determine irreversible cessation of the total brain, including coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes. this criteria was updated again, most recently in , but substantial discrepancies remain across hospitals and medical specialties.

the problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the dead donor rule, which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement, or that organ procurement cannot result in the death of the donor. a great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. advocates of the rule believe that the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering any moral or legal objection to organ procurement. critics, on the other hand, believe that the rule does not uphold the best interests of the donors and that the rule does not effectively promote organ donation.

the death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between jurisdictions. most countries follow the wholebrain death criteria, where all functions of the brain must have completely ceased. however, in other jurisdictions, some follow the brainstem version of brain death. afterward, a death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor or by an administrative office, upon presentation of a doctors declaration of death.

there are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then coming back to life, sometimes days later in their coffin or when embalming procedures are about to begin. from the midth century onwards, there was an upsurge in the publics fear of being mistakenly buried alive and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpses mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum. writing in , the physician j.c. ouseley claimed that as many as , people were buried prematurely each year in england and wales, although some estimates peg the figure to be closer to .in cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation  for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. people found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. this diving response, in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex.as medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be reevaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death . the lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. therefore, the concept of informationtheoretic death has been suggested as a better means of defining when true death occurs, though the concept has few practical applications outside the field of cryonics.

the leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease. the leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis , cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. by an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging, leading to various complications known as agingassociated diseases. these conditions cause loss of homeostasis, leading to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues. of the roughly , people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of agerelated causes. in industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching . with improved medical capability, dying has become a condition to be managed.

in developing nations, inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern medical technology make death from infectious diseases more common than in developed countries. one such disease is tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that killed . million people in . malaria causes about  million cases of fever and m deaths annually. the aids death toll in africa may reach  million by .according to jean ziegler, the united nations special reporter on the right to food,   mar , mortality due to malnutrition accounted for  of the total mortality rate in . ziegler says worldwide, approximately  million people died from all causes and of those deaths, more than  million died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients.

tobacco smoking killed  million people worldwide in the th century and could kill  billion people worldwide in the st century, a world health organization report warned.many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. the evolutionary cause of aging is, at best, only beginning to be understood. it has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.selye proposed a unified nonspecific approach to many causes of death. he demonstrated that stress decreases the adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe adaptability as a special resource, adaptation energy. the animal dies when this resource is exhausted. selye assumed that adaptability is a finite supply presented at birth. later, goldstone proposed the concept of production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored  as a capital reserve of adaptation. in recent works, adaptation energy is considered an internal coordinate on the dominant path in the model of adaptation. it is demonstrated that oscillations of wellbeing appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.

in , suicide overtook car crashes as the leading cause of human injury deaths in the u.s., followed by poisoning, falls, and murder.accidents and disasters, from nuclear disasters to structural collapses, also claim lives. one of the deadliest incidents of all time is the failure of the  banqiao dam failure, with varying estimates, up to , dead. other incidents with high death tolls are; the wanggongchang explosion when a gunpowder factory ended up with , deaths, a collapse of a wall of circus maximus killing , people, and the chernobyl disaster killing between  and , people.natural disasters kill around , people annually, although this number can vary to millions to thousands on a per decade basis. some of the deadliest natural disasters are the  china floods, which killed and estimated  million people, although, estimates widely vary, the  yellow river flood, which killed an estimated  million people in china, and the  bhola cyclone, killing , people in pakistan.in animals, predation can be a common cause of death. livestock have a  death rate from predation. however, younger animals are more susceptible to predation. for example,  of young foxes die to birds, bobcats, coyotes, and other foxes as well. young bear cubs in the yellowstone national park only have a  chance to survive to adulthood from other bears and predators.

an autopsy, also known as a postmortem examination or an obduction, is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a persons death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. it is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together.a necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination. in modern times, this term is more commonly associated with the corpses of animals.

death before birth can happen in several ways stillbirth, when the fetus dies before or during the delivery process; miscarriage, when the embryo dies before independent survival; and abortion, the artificial termination of the pregnancy. stillbirth and miscarriage can happen for various reasons, while abortion is carried out purposely.

stillbirth can happen right before or after the delivery of a fetus. it can result from defects of the fetus or risk factors present in the mother. reductions of these factors, caesarean sections when risks are present, and early detection of birth defects have lowered the rate of stillbirth. however,  of births in the united states end in a stillbirth.

a miscarriage is defined by the world health organization as, the expulsion or extraction from its mother of an embryo or fetus weighing g or less. miscarriage is one of the most frequent problems in pregnancy, and is reported in around  of all clinical pregnancies; however, by including pregnancy losses during menstruation, it could be up to  of all pregnancies. there are many riskfactors involved in miscarriage; consumption of caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, having a previous miscarriage, and the use of abortion can increase the chances of having a miscarriage.

an abortion may be performed for many reasons, such as pregnancy from rape, financial constraints of having a child, teenage pregnancy, and the lack of support from a significant other. there are two forms of abortion a medical abortion and an inclinic abortion or sometimes referred to as a surgical abortion. a medical abortion involves taking a pill that will terminate the pregnancy no more than  weeks past the last period, and an inclinic abortion involves a medical procedure using suction to empty the uterus; this is possible after  weeks, but it may be more difficult to find an operating doctor who will go through with the procedure.

senescence refers to a scenario when a living being can survive all calamities but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. conversely, premature death can refer to a death that occurs before old age arrives, for example, human death before a person reaches the age of . animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from the deterioration of cellular activity and the ruination of regular functioning. the aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and longterm loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. in the united kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur daily relates to senescence, while around the world, it accounts for twothirds of , deaths that take place daily.almost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging, known in life sciences as senescence. some organisms experience negligible senescence, even exhibiting biological immortality. these include the jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii, the hydra, and the planarian. unnatural causes of death include suicide and predation. of all causes, roughly , people die around the world each day. of these, twothirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries  such as the united states, the united kingdom, and germany  the rate approaches  .physiological death is now seen as a process, more than an event conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible. where in the process, a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs. in general, clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death. a patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring.

life extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan, especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the processes of aging through antiaging measures. although aging is the most common cause of death worldwide, it is socially mostly ignored as such and seen as necessary and inevitable anyway, which is why little money is spent on research into antiaging therapies, a phenomenon known as proaging trance.the average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestylerelated afflictions such as cancer or cardiovascular disease. extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good diet, exercise, and avoidance of hazards such as smoking. maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes. currently, the only widely recognized method of extending the maximum lifespan is calorie restriction. theoretically, the extension of the maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, or by molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues.a united states poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes, have similar rates of support for life extension, while africans and hispanics have higher rates of support than white people. thirtyeight percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as biomedical gerontologists. they try to understand the nature of aging, and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or at least slow them down for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them to themselves are called life extensionists or longevists. the primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available antiaging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure for aging once it is developed.

cryonics  is the lowtemperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future.cryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. the stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent informationtheoretic definition of death.some scientific literature is claimed to support the feasibility of cryonics. medical science and cryobiologists generally regard cryonics with skepticism.

around , most people in western countries died in their own homes, surrounded by family, and comforted by clergy, neighbors, and doctors making house calls. by the midth century, half of all americans died in a hospital. by the start of the st century, only about  to  of people in developed countries died outside of a medical institution. the shift from dying at home towards dying in a professional medical environment has been termed the invisible death. this shift occurred gradually over the years until most deaths now occur outside the home.

death studies is a field within psychology. to varying degrees people inherently fear death, both the process and the eventuality; it is hard wired and part of the survival instinct of all animals. discussing, thinking about, or planning for their deaths causes them discomfort. this fear may cause them to put off financial planning, preparing a will and testament, or requesting help from a hospice organization.

mortality salience is the awareness that death is inevitable. however, selfesteem and culture are ways to reduce the anxiety this effect can cause. the awareness of someones own death can cause a deepened bond in their ingroup as a defense mechanism. this can also cause the person to become very judging. in a study, two groups were formed; one group was asked to reflect upon their mortality, the other was not, afterwards, the groups were told to set a bond for a prostitute. the group that did not reflect on death had an average of , the group who was reminded about their death had an average of  dollars.different people have different responses to the idea of their deaths. philosopher galen strawson writes that the death that many people wish for is an instant, painless, unexperienced annihilation. in this unlikely scenario, the person dies without realizing it and without being able to fear it. one moment the person is walking, eating, or sleeping, and the next moment, the person is dead. strawson reasons that this type of death would not take anything away from the person, as he believes a person cannot have a legitimate claim to ownership in the future.

in society, the nature of death and humanitys awareness of its mortality has, for millennia, been a concern of the worlds religious traditions and philosophical inquiry. including belief in resurrection or an afterlife , reincarnation or rebirth , or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as eternal oblivion .commemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning, funeral practices, and ceremonies of honoring the deceased. the physical remains of a person, commonly known as a corpse or body, are usually interred whole or cremated, though among the worlds cultures, there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal. in the english language, blessings directed towards a dead person include rest in peace  or its initialism rip.

death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. the disposal of human corpses does, in general, begin with the last offices before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or cremation. this is not a unified practice; in tibet, for instance, the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top. proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer ones spiritual attainments into another body  are subjects of detailed study in tibet. mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures to retard the rate of decay.some parts of death in culture are legally based, having laws for when death occurs, such as the receiving of a death certificate, the settlement of the deceased estate, and the issues of inheritance and, in some countries, inheritance taxation.capital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. in most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice. in some countries, sexual crimes, such as adultery and sodomy, carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes, such as apostasy, the formal renunciation of ones religion. in many retentionist countries, drug trafficking is also a capital offense. in china, human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty. in militaries around the world, courtsmartial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny.death in warfare and suicide attack also have cultural links, and the ideas of dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, which translates to it is sweet and proper to die for ones country, mutiny punishable by death, such as in the united states, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures. recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the september  attacks, but also further back in time with suicide bombings, kamikaze missions in world war ii, and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and martyrdom have had significant cultural impacts.suicide, in general, and particularly euthanasia, are also points of cultural debate. both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. in japan, for example, ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional christian and islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin.

death is personified in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the grim reaper, azrael, the hindu god yama, and father time. in the west, the grim reaper, or figures similar to it, is the most popular depiction of death in western cultures.in brazil, death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a governmentauthorized registry. before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório. though a public registry law guarantees all brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means of their family members , the brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs, and fees of filing for a death. for many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, and cultural burial, which, in turn, raises the debate about inaccurate mortality rates.talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue in most cultures. western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. eastern societies  may be more open to accepting it as a fait accompli, with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an openair burningtoashes.

the origin of death is a theme or myth of how death came to be. it is present in nearly all cultures across the world, as death is a universal happening. this makes it an origin myth, a myth that describes how a feature of the natural or social world appeared. there can be some similarities between myths and cultures. in north american mythology, the theme of a man who wants to be immortal and a man who wants to die can be seen across many indigenous people. in christianity, death is the result of the fall of man after eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. in greek mythology, the opening of pandoras box releases death upon the world.

much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to ones consciousness as ones body dies. the belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called eternal oblivion. the belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term afterlife. neither is likely to be confirmed without the ponderer having to die.

neardeath experiences are the closest thing people have to an afterlife that we know. some people who have had neardeath experiences  report that they have seen the afterlife while they were dead. seeing a being of light and talking with it, life flashing before the eyes, and the confirmation of cultural beliefs of the afterlife are all themes that happen during the moments they are dead.

after death, the remains of a former organism become part of the biogeochemical cycle, during which animals may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger. organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms that recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain, where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of an organism. examples of detritivores include earthworms, woodlice, and millipedes.microorganisms also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. not all materials need to be fully decomposed. coal, a fossil fuel formed over vast tracts of time in swamp ecosystems, is one example.

the contemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection. it is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die, having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool. their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to extinction and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as speciation. frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to darwinian criteria, much greater fitness than a longlived organism leaving only one.death also has a role in competition, where if a species outcompetes another, there is a risk of death for the population. especially in the case where they are directly fighting over resources.

death plays a role in extinction, the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa, reducing biodiversity, due to extinction being generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species . because a species potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively.

inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age. however, there are exceptions, such as hydra and the jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii, which research shows to be biologically immortal.organisms showing only asexual reproduction, such as bacteria, some protists, like the euglenoids and many amoebozoans, and unicellular organisms with sexual reproduction, colonial or not, like the volvocine algae pandorina and chlamydomonas, are immortal at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. in multicellular organisms and also in multinucleate ciliates with a weismannist development, that is, with a division of labor between mortal somatic  cells and immortal germ  cells, death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.the volvox algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence, include the death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its life history.

animals have sometimes shown grief for their partners or friends. when two chimpanzees form a bond together, sexual or not, and one of them dies, the surviving chimpanzee will show signs of grief, ripping out their hair in anger and starting to cry; if the body is removed, they will resist, they will eventually go quiet when the body is gone, but upon seeing the body again, the chimp will return to a violent state.

some nonliving things can be considered dead. for example, a volcano, batteries, electrical components, and stars are all nonliving things that can die, whether from destruction or cessation of function.

a volcano, a break in the earths crust that allows lava, ash, and gases to escape, has three states that it may be in, active, dormant, and extinct. an active volcano has recently or is currently erupting; in a dormant volcano, it has not erupted for a significant amount of time, but it may erupt again; in an extinct volcano, it may be cut off from the supply of its lava and will never expected to erupt again, so the volcano can be considered to be dead.a battery can be considered dead after the charge is fully used up. electrical components are similar in this fashion, in the case that it may not be able to be used again,  such as after a spill of water on the components, the component can be considered dead.

stars also have a lifespan and, therefore, can die. after it starts to run out of fuel, it starts to expand, this can be analogous to the star aging. after it exhausts all fuel, it may explode in a supernova, collapse into a black hole, or turn into a neutron star.

in buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. awareness of death motivated prince siddhartha to strive to find the deathless and finally attain enlightenment. in buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being. being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. the belief in rebirth among buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering, and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.death is part of several key buddhist tenets, such as the four noble truths and dependent origination.

while there are different sects of christianity with different branches of belief, the overarching ideology on death grows from the knowledge of the afterlife. after death, the individual will undergo a separation from mortality to immortality; their soul leaves the body entering a realm of spirits. following this separation of body and spirit , resurrection will occur. representing the same transformation jesus christ embodied after his body was placed in the tomb for three days, each persons body will be resurrected, reuniting the spirit and body in a perfect form. this process allows the individuals soul to withstand death and transform into life after death.

in hindu texts, death is described as the individual eternal spiritual jivaatma  exiting the current temporary material body. the soul exits this body when the body can no longer sustain the conscious self , which may be due to mental or physical reasons or, more accurately, the inability to act on ones kama . during conception, the soul enters a compatible new body based on the remaining merits and demerits of ones karma  and the state of ones mind  at the time of death.usually, the process of reincarnation makes one forget all memories of ones previous life. because nothing really dies and the temporary material body is always changing, both in this life and the next, death means forgetfulness of ones previous experiences.

the islamic view is that death is the separation of the soul from the body as well as the beginning of the afterlife. the afterlife, or akhirah, is one of the six main beliefs in islam. rather than seeing death as the end of life, muslims consider death as a continuation of life in another form. in islam, life on earth right now is a short, temporary life and a testing period for every soul. true life begins with the day of judgement when all people will be divided into two groups. the righteous believers will be welcomed to janna , and the disbelievers and evildoers will be punished in jahannam .muslims believe death to be wholly natural and predetermined by god. only god knows the exact time of a persons death. the quran emphasizes that death is inevitable, no matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone.  life on earth is the one and only chance for people to prepare themselves for the life to come and choose to either believe or not believe in god, and death is the end of that learning opportunity.

there are a variety of beliefs about the afterlife within judaism, but none of them contradict the preference for life over death. this is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any commandments.

the word death comes from old english dēaþ, which in turn comes from protogermanic dauþuz . this comes from the protoindoeuropean stem dheu meaning the process, act, condition of dying.the concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms. when a person has died, it is also said they have passed away, passed on, expired, or gone, among other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms.

as a formal reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the participle form of decease, as in the deceased; another noun form is decedent.

bereft of life, the dead person is a corpse, cadaver, body, set of remains or, when all flesh is gone, a skeleton. the terms carrion and carcass are also used, usually for dead nonhuman animals. the ashes left after a cremation are lately called cremains.

william shakespeare  was an english playwright, poet and actor. he is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the english language and the worlds preeminent dramatist. he is often called englands national poet and the bard of avon . his extant works, including collaborations, consist of some  plays,  sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. his plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the english language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

shakespeare was born and raised in stratforduponavon, warwickshire. at the age of , he married anne hathaway, with whom he had three children susanna, and twins hamnet and judith. sometime between  and , he began a successful career in london as an actor, writer, and partowner  of a playing company called the lord chamberlains men, later known as the kings men. at age  , he appears to have retired to stratford, where he died three years later. few records of shakespeares private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.shakespeare produced most of his known works between  and . his early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. he then wrote mainly tragedies until , among them hamlet, romeo and juliet, othello, king lear, and macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the english language. in the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies  and collaborated with other playwrights.

many of shakespeares plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. however, in , john heminges and henry condell, two fellow actors and friends of shakespeares, published a more definitive text known as the first folio, a posthumous collected edition of shakespeares dramatic works that includes  of his plays. its preface was a prescient poem by ben jonson, a former rival of shakespeare, that hailed shakespeare with the now famous epithet not of an age, but for all time.

shakespeare was the son of john shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover  originally from snitterfield in warwickshire, and mary arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. he was born in stratforduponavon, where he was baptised on  april . his date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on  april, saint georges day. this date, which can be traced to william oldys and george steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because shakespeare died on the same date in . he was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that shakespeare was probably educated at the kings new school in stratford, a free school chartered in , about a quartermile  from his home. grammar schools varied in quality during the elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar the basic latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon latin classical authors.at the age of , shakespeare married yearold anne hathaway. the consistory court of the diocese of worcester issued a marriage licence on  november . the next day, two of hathaways neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. the ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage anne gave birth to a daughter, susanna, baptised  may . twins, son hamnet and daughter judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised  february . hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of  and was buried  august .

after the birth of the twins, shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the london theatre scene in . the exception is the appearance of his name in the complaints bill of a law case before the queens bench court at westminster dated michaelmas term  and  october . scholars refer to the years between  and  as shakespeares lost years. biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. nicholas rowe, shakespeares first biographer, recounted a stratford legend that shakespeare fled the town for london to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire thomas lucy. shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. another thcentury story has shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in london. john aubrey reported that shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. some thcentury scholars suggested that shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by alexander hoghton of lancashire, a catholic landowner who named a certain william shakeshafte in his will. little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and shakeshafte was a common name in the lancashire area.

it is not known definitively when shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the london stage by . by then, he was sufficiently known in london to be attacked in print by the playwright robert greene in his groatsworth of wit from that year

... there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his tigers heart wrapped in a players hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you and being an absolute johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only shakescene in a country.

scholars differ on the exact meaning of greenes words, but most agree that greene was accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such universityeducated writers as christopher marlowe, thomas nashe, and greene himself . the italicised phrase parodying the line oh, tigers heart wrapped in a womans hide from shakespeares henry vi, part , along with the pun shakescene, clearly identify shakespeare as greenes target. as used here, johannes factotum  refers to a secondrate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common universal genius.greenes attack is the earliest surviving mention of shakespeares work in the theatre. biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mids to just before greenes remarks. after , shakespeares plays were performed only by the lord chamberlains men, a company owned by a group of players, including shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in london. after the death of queen elizabeth in , the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king james i, and changed its name to the kings men.

in , a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the river thames, which they named the globe. in , the partnership also took over the blackfriars indoor theatre. extant records of shakespeares property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in , he bought the secondlargest house in stratford, new place, and in , invested in a share of the parish tithes in stratford.some of shakespeares plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in , and by , his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. the  edition of ben jonsons works names him on the cast lists for every man in his humour  and sejanus his fall . the absence of his name from the  cast list for jonsons volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. the first folio of , however, lists shakespeare as one of the principal actors in all these plays, some of which were first staged after volpone, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. in , john davies of hereford wrote that good will played kingly roles. in , rowe passed down a tradition that shakespeare played the ghost of hamlets father. later traditions maintain that he also played adam in as you like it, and the chorus in henry v, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.throughout his career, shakespeare divided his time between london and stratford. in , the year before he bought new place as his family home in stratford, shakespeare was living in the parish of st helens, bishopsgate, north of the river thames. he moved across the river to southwark by , the same year his company constructed the globe theatre there. by , he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of st pauls cathedral with many fine houses. there, he rented rooms from a french huguenot named christopher mountjoy, a maker of womens wigs and other headgear.

nicholas rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by samuel johnson, that shakespeare retired to stratford some years before his death. he was still working as an actor in london in ; in an answer to the sharers petition in , cuthbert burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the blackfriars theatre in  from henry evans, the kings men placed men players there, which were heminges, condell, shakespeare, etc.. however, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in london throughout . the london public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague , which meant there was often no acting work. retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. shakespeare continued to visit london during the years . in , he was called as a witness in bellott v mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of mountjoys daughter, mary. in march , he bought a gatehouse in the former blackfriars priory; and from november , he was in london for several weeks with his soninlaw, john hall. after , shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after . his last three plays were collaborations, probably with john fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the kings men. he retired in , before the globe theatre burned down during the performance of henry viii on  june.shakespeare died on  april , at the age of . he died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in perfect health. no extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. half a century later, john ward, the vicar of stratford, wrote in his notebook shakespeare, drayton, and ben jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for shakespeare died of a fever there contracted, not an impossible scenario since shakespeare knew jonson and drayton. of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death we wondered, shakespeare, that thou wentst so soon / from the worlds stage to the graves tiring room.

he was survived by his wife and two daughters. susanna had married a physician, john hall, in , and judith had married thomas quiney, a vintner, two months before shakespeares death. shakespeare signed his last will and testament on  march ; the following day, his new soninlaw, thomas quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by margaret wheeler, who had died during childbirth. thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the shakespeare family.shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to the first son of her body. the quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. the halls had one child, elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in , ending shakespeares direct line. shakespeares will scarcely mentions his wife, anne, who was probably entitled to onethird of his estate automatically. he did make a point, however, of leaving her my second best bed, a bequest that has led to much speculation. some scholars see the bequest as an insult to anne, whereas others believe that the secondbest bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.

shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the holy trinity church two days after his death. the epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 

some time before , a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a halfeffigy of him in the act of writing. its plaque compares him to nestor, socrates, and virgil. in , in conjunction with the publication of the first folio, the droeshout engraving was published. shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in southwark cathedral and poets corner in westminster abbey.

most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.the first recorded works of shakespeare are richard iii and the three parts of henry vi, written in the early s during a vogue for historical drama. shakespeares plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that titus andronicus, the comedy of errors, the taming of the shrew, and the two gentlemen of verona may also belong to shakespeares earliest period. his first histories, which draw heavily on the  edition of raphael holinsheds chronicles of england, scotland, and ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the tudor dynasty. the early plays were influenced by the works of other elizabethan dramatists, especially thomas kyd and christopher marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of seneca. the comedy of errors was also based on classical models, but no source for the taming of the shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. like the two gentlemen of verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the shrews story of the taming of a womans independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.

shakespeares early classical and italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mids to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. a midsummer nights dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. shakespeares next comedy, the equally romantic merchant of venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful jewish moneylender shylock, which reflects dominant elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. the wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing, the charming rural setting of as you like it, and the lively merrymaking of twelfth night complete shakespeares sequence of great comedies. after the lyrical richard ii, written almost entirely in verse, shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late s, henry iv, parts  and , and henry v. his characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. this period begins and ends with two tragedies romeo and juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and julius caesarbased on sir thomas norths  translation of plutarchs parallel liveswhich introduced a new kind of drama. according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro, in julius caesar, the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even shakespeares own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other.

in the early th century, shakespeare wrote the socalled problem plays measure for measure, troilus and cressida, and alls well that ends well and a number of his best known tragedies. many critics believe that shakespeares greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. the titular hero of one of shakespeares greatest tragedies, hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins to be or not to be; that is the question. unlike the introverted hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, othello and king lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement. the plots of shakespeares tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. in othello, the villain iago stokes othellos sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. in king lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the earl of gloucester and the murder of lears youngest daughter cordelia. according to the critic frank kermode, the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty. in macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of shakespeares tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites macbeth and his wife, lady macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. in this play, shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. his last major tragedies, antony and cleopatra and coriolanus, contain some of shakespeares finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic t. s. eliot.in his final period, shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays cymbeline, the winters tale, and the tempest, as well as the collaboration, pericles, prince of tyre. less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on shakespeares part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, henry viii and the two noble kinsmen, probably with john fletcher.

shakespeares works include the  plays printed in the first folio of , listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies. two plays not included in the first folio, the two noble kinsmen and pericles, prince of tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with todays scholars agreeing that shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. no shakespearean poems were included in the first folio.

in the late th century, edward dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, dowdens term is often used. in , frederick s. boas coined the term problem plays to describe four plays alls well that ends well, measure for measure, troilus and cressida, and hamlet. dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies, he wrote. we may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as shakespeares problem plays. the term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.

it is not clear for which companies shakespeare wrote his early plays. the title page of the  edition of titus andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. after the plagues of , shakespeares plays were performed by his own company at the theatre and the curtain in shoreditch, north of the thames. londoners flocked there to see the first part of henry iv, leonard digges recording, let but falstaff come, hal, poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room. when the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled the theatre down and used the timbers to construct the globe theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the thames at southwark. the globe opened in autumn , with julius caesar one of the first plays staged. most of shakespeares greatest post plays were written for the globe, including hamlet, othello, and king lear.

after the lord chamberlains men were renamed the kings men in , they entered a special relationship with the new king james. although the performance records are patchy, the kings men performed seven of shakespeares plays at court between  november , and  october , including two performances of the merchant of venice. after , they performed at the indoor blackfriars theatre during the winter and the globe during the summer. the indoor setting, combined with the jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. in cymbeline, for example, jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt. the ghosts fall on their knees.the actors in shakespeares company included the famous richard burbage, william kempe, henry condell and john heminges. burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of shakespeares plays, including richard iii, hamlet, othello, and king lear. the popular comic actor will kempe played the servant peter in romeo and juliet and dogberry in much ado about nothing, among other characters. he was replaced around  by robert armin, who played roles such as touchstone in as you like it and the fool in king lear. in , sir henry wotton recorded that henry viii was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony. on  june, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a shakespeare play with rare precision.

in , john heminges and henry condell, two of shakespeares friends from the kings men, published the first folio, a collected edition of shakespeares plays. it contained  texts, including  printed for the first time. the others had already appeared in quarto versionsflimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. no evidence suggests that shakespeare approved these editions, which the first folio describes as stoln and surreptitious copies.alfred pollard termed some of the pre versions as bad quartos because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. the differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from shakespeares own papers. in some cases, for example, hamlet, troilus and cressida, and othello, shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. in the case of king lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the  folio version is so different from the  quarto that the oxford shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.

in  and , when the theatres were closed because of plague, shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece. he dedicated them to henry wriothesley, earl of southampton. in venus and adonis, an innocent adonis rejects the sexual advances of venus; while in the rape of lucrece, the virtuous wife lucrece is raped by the lustful tarquin. influenced by ovids metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. both proved popular and were often reprinted during shakespeares lifetime. a third narrative poem, a lovers complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the sonnets in . most scholars now accept that shakespeare wrote a lovers complaint. critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. the phoenix and the turtle, printed in robert chesters  loves martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. in , two early drafts of sonnets  and  appeared in the passionate pilgrim, published under shakespeares name but without his permission.

published in , the sonnets were the last of shakespeares nondramatic works to be printed. scholars are not certain when each of the  sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in the passionate pilgrim in , francis meres had referred in  to shakespeares sugred sonnets among his private friends. few analysts believe that the published collection follows shakespeares intended sequence. he seems to have planned two contrasting series one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion , and one about conflicted love for a fair young man . it remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial i who addresses them represents shakespeare himself, though wordsworth believed that with the sonnets shakespeare unlocked his heart.

the  edition was dedicated to a mr. w.h., credited as the only begetter of the poems. it is not known whether this was written by shakespeare himself or by the publisher, thomas thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who mr. w.h. was, despite numerous theories, or whether shakespeare even authorised the publication. critics praise the sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.

shakespeares first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. he wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. the poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetoricalwritten for actors to declaim rather than speak. the grand speeches in titus andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in the two gentlemen of verona has been described as stilted.

however, shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. the opening soliloquy of richard iii has its roots in the selfdeclaration of vice in medieval drama. at the same time, richards vivid selfawareness looks forward to the soliloquies of shakespeares mature plays. no single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with romeo and juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. by the time of romeo and juliet, richard ii, and a midsummer nights dream in the mids, shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. he increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

shakespeares standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. in practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. the blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. it is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony. once shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. this technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as julius caesar and hamlet. shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in hamlets mind

after hamlet, shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. the literary critic a. c. bradley described this style as more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical. in the last phase of his career, shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. these included runon lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. in macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another was the hope drunk/ wherein you dressed yourself ; ... pity, like a naked newborn babe/ striding the blast, or heavens cherubim, horsd/ upon the sightless couriers of the air ... . the listener is challenged to complete the sense. the late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as plutarch and holinshed. he reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. this strength of design ensures that a shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. as shakespeares mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. he preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. in shakespeares late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.

shakespeares work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. in particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre. until romeo and juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but shakespeare used them to explore characters minds. his work heavily influenced later poetry. the romantic poets attempted to revive shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. critic george steiner described all english verse dramas from coleridge to tennyson as feeble variations on shakespearean themes. john milton, considered by many to be the most important english poet after shakespeare, wrote in tribute thou in our wonder and astonishment/ has built thyself a livelong monument.shakespeare influenced novelists such as thomas hardy, william faulkner, and charles dickens. the american novelist herman melvilles soliloquies owe much to shakespeare; his captain ahab in mobydick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by king lear. scholars have identified , pieces of music linked to shakespeares works. these include three operas by giuseppe verdi, macbeth, otello and falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the romantics and the preraphaelites, while william hogarths  painting of actor david garrick playing richard iii was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in britain. the swiss romantic artist henry fuseli, a friend of william blake, even translated macbeth into german. the psychoanalyst sigmund freud drew on shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of hamlet, for his theories of human nature. shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; akira kurosawa adapted macbeth and king lear as throne of blood and ran, respectively. other examples of shakespeare on film include max reinhardts a midsummer nights dream, laurence oliviers hamlet and al pacinos documentary looking for richard. orson welles, a lifelong lover of shakespeare, directed and starred in films of macbeth and othello, and chimes at midnight, in which he plays john falstaff, which welles himself called his best work.in shakespeares day, english grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern english. samuel johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his a dictionary of the english language, the first serious work of its type. expressions such as with bated breath  and a foregone conclusion  have found their way into everyday english speech.shakespeares influence extends far beyond his native england and the english language. his reception in germany was particularly significant; as early as the th century shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in germany, and gradually became a classic of the german weimar era; christoph martin wieland was the first to produce complete translations of shakespeares plays in any language. actor and theatre director simon callow writes, this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly british and so effortlessly universal, each different culture  german, italian, russian  was obliged to respond to the shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. some of the most deeply affecting productions of shakespeare have been nonenglish, and noneuropean. he is that unique writer he has something for everyone.according to guinness world records, shakespeare remains the worlds bestselling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost  years since his death. he is also the third most translated author in history.

shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise. in , the cleric and author francis meres singled him out from a group of english playwrights as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy. the authors of the parnassus plays at st johns college, cambridge, numbered him with chaucer, gower, and spenser. in the first folio, ben jonson called shakespeare the soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage, although he had remarked elsewhere that shakespeare wanted art .between the restoration of the monarchy in  and the end of the th century, classical ideas were in vogue. as a result, critics of the time mostly rated shakespeare below john fletcher and ben jonson. thomas rymer, for example, condemned shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. nevertheless, poet and critic john dryden rated shakespeare highly, saying of jonson, i admire him, but i love shakespeare. he also famously remarked that shakespeare was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there. for several decades, rymers view held sway. but during the th century, critics began to respond to shakespeare on his own terms and, like dryden, to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. a series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of samuel johnson in  and edmond malone in , added to his growing reputation. by , he was firmly enshrined as the national poet, and described as the bard of avon . in the th and th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. among those who championed him were the writers voltaire, goethe, stendhal, and victor hugo.

during the romantic era, shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher samuel taylor coleridge, and the critic august wilhelm schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of german romanticism. in the th century, critical admiration for shakespeares genius often bordered on adulation. this king shakespeare, the essayist thomas carlyle wrote in , does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible. the victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. the playwright and critic george bernard shaw mocked the cult of shakespeare worship as bardolatry, claiming that the new naturalism of ibsens plays had made shakespeare obsolete.the modernist revolution in the arts during the early th century, far from discarding shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avantgarde. the expressionists in germany and the futurists in moscow mounted productions of his plays. marxist playwright and director bertolt brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of shakespeare. the poet and critic t. s. eliot argued against shaw that shakespeares primitiveness in fact made him truly modern. eliot, along with g. wilson knight and the school of new criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of shakespeares imagery. in the s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for postmodern studies of shakespeare. by the s, shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, new historicism, africanamerican studies, and queer studies. comparing shakespeares accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, harold bloom wrote, shakespeare was larger than plato and than st. augustine. he encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions.

around  years after shakespeares death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. proposed alternative candidates include francis bacon, christopher marlowe, and edward de vere, th earl of oxford. several group theories have also been proposed. all but a few shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, but interest in the subject, particularly the oxfordian theory of shakespeare authorship, continues into the st century.

shakespeare conformed to the official state religion, but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. shakespeares will uses a protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the church of england, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. some scholars claim that members of shakespeares family were catholics, at a time when practising catholicism in england was against the law. shakespeares mother, mary arden, certainly came from a pious catholic family. the strongest evidence might be a catholic statement of faith signed by his father, john shakespeare, found in  in the rafters of his former house in henley street. however, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. in , the authorities reported that john shakespeare had missed church for fear of process for debt, a common catholic excuse. in , the name of williams daughter susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend easter communion in stratford. other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about shakespeares religious beliefs. scholars find evidence both for and against shakespeares catholicism, protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.

few details of shakespeares sexuality are known. at , he married yearold anne hathaway, who was pregnant. susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on  may . over the centuries, some readers have posited that shakespeares sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. the  socalled dark lady sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.

no written contemporary description of shakespeares physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the droeshout engraving, which ben jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. from the th century, the desire for authentic shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted shakespeare. that demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.

sir winston leonard spencer churchill  was a british statesman, soldier, and writer who twice served as prime minister of the united kingdom, from  to  during the second world war, and again from  to . apart from two years between  and , he was a member of parliament  from  to  and represented a total of five constituencies. ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism, he was for most of his career a member of the conservative party, which he led from  to . he was a member of the liberal party from  to .

of mixed english and american parentage, churchill was born in oxfordshire into the wealthy, aristocratic spencer family. he joined the british army in  and saw action in british india, the mahdist war , and the second boer war, later gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. elected a conservative mp in , he defected to the liberals in . in h. h. asquiths liberal government, churchill served as president of the board of trade and home secretary, championing prison reform and workers social security. as first lord of the admiralty during the first world war, he oversaw the gallipoli campaign but, after it proved a disaster, he was demoted to chancellor of the duchy of lancaster. he resigned in november  and joined the royal scots fusiliers on the western front for six months. in , he returned to government under david lloyd george and served successively as minister of munitions, secretary of state for war, secretary of state for air, and secretary of state for the colonies, overseeing the angloirish treaty and british foreign policy in the middle east. after two years out of parliament, he served as chancellor of the exchequer in stanley baldwins conservative government, returning the pound sterling in  to the gold standard at its prewar parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the uk economy.

out of government during his socalled wilderness years in the s, churchill took the lead in calling for british rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in nazi germany. at the outbreak of the second world war he was reappointed first lord of the admiralty. in may , he became prime minister, succeeding neville chamberlain. churchill formed a national government and oversaw british involvement in the allied war effort against the axis powers, resulting in victory in . after the conservatives defeat in the  general election, he became leader of the opposition. amid the developing cold war with the soviet union, he publicly warned of an iron curtain of soviet influence in europe and promoted european unity. between his terms as prime minister, he wrote several books recounting his experience during the war. he was awarded the nobel prize for literature in . he lost the  election but was returned to office in . his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially angloamerican relations and preservation of what remained of the british empire with india now no longer part of it. domestically, his government emphasised housebuilding and completed the development of a nuclear weapon . in declining health, churchill resigned as prime minister in , remaining an mp until . upon his death in , he was given a state funeral.

widely considered one of the th centurys most significant figures, churchill remains popular in the uk and the rest of the anglosphere where he is generally viewed as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. while he has been criticised for his views on race and empire alongside some of his wartime decisions, historians often rank churchill as the greatest prime minister in british history.

churchill was born on  november  at his familys ancestral home, blenheim palace in oxfordshire. on his fathers side, he was a member of the british aristocracy as a direct descendant of john churchill, st duke of marlborough. his father, lord randolph churchill, representing the conservative party, had been elected member of parliament  for woodstock in . his mother, jennie, was a daughter of leonard jerome, a wealthy american businessman.in , churchills paternal grandfather, john spencerchurchill, th duke of marlborough, was appointed viceroy of ireland, then part of the united kingdom. randolph became his private secretary and the family relocated to dublin. winstons brother, jack, was born there in . throughout much of the s, randolph and jennie were effectively estranged, and the brothers were mostly cared for by their nanny, elizabeth everest. when she died in , churchill wrote that she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years i had lived.churchill began boarding at st georges school in ascot, berkshire, at age seven but was not academic and his behaviour was poor. in , he transferred to brunswick school in hove, where his academic performance improved. in april , aged , he narrowly passed the entrance exam for harrow school. his father wanted him to prepare for a military career and so his last three years at harrow were in the army form. after two unsuccessful attempts to gain admittance to the royal military academy, sandhurst, he succeeded on his third. he was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry, starting in september . his father died in january , a month after churchill graduated from sandhurst.

in february , churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the th queens own hussars regiment of the british army, based at aldershot. eager to witness military action, he used his mothers influence to get himself posted to a war zone. in the autumn of , he and his friend reggie barnes, then a subaltern, went to cuba to observe the war of independence and became involved in skirmishes after joining spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters. churchill sent reports about the conflict to the daily graphic in london. he proceeded to new york city and, in admiration of the united states, wrote to his mother about what an extraordinary people the americans are. with the hussars, he went to bombay in october . based in bangalore, he was in india for  months, visiting calcutta three times and joining expeditions to hyderabad and the north west frontier.in india, churchill began a selfeducation project, reading a range of authors including plato, edward gibbon, charles darwin and thomas babington macaulay. the books were sent to him by his mother, with whom he shared frequent correspondence when abroad. in order to learn about politics, he also asked his mother to send him copies of the annual register, the political almanac. in one  letter to her, he referred to his religious beliefs, saying i do not accept the christian or any other form of religious belief. churchill had been christened in the church of england but, as he related later, he underwent a virulently antichristian phase in his youth, and as an adult was an agnostic. in another letter to one of his cousins, he referred to religion as a delicious narcotic and expressed a preference for protestantism over roman catholicism because he felt it a step nearer reason.interested in british parliamentary affairs, he declared himself a liberal in all but name, adding that he could never endorse the liberal partys support for irish home rule. instead, he allied himself to the tory democracy wing of the conservative party and on a visit home, gave his first public speech for the partys primrose league at claverton down, near bath. mixing reformist and conservative perspectives, he supported the promotion of secular, nondenominational education while opposing womens suffrage.churchill volunteered to join bindon bloods malakand field force in its campaign against mohmand rebels in the swat valley of northwest india. blood accepted him on condition that he was assigned as a journalist, the beginning of churchills writing career. he returned to bangalore in october  and there wrote his first book, the story of the malakand field force, which received positive reviews. he also wrote his only work of fiction, savrola, a ruritanian romance. to keep himself fully occupied, churchill embraced writing as what roy jenkins calls his whole habit, especially through his political career when he was out of office. writing was his main safeguard against recurring depression, which he referred to as his black dog.using his contacts in london, churchill got himself attached to general kitcheners campaign in the sudan as a st lancers subaltern while, additionally, working as a journalist for the morning post. after fighting in the battle of omdurman on  september , the st lancers were stood down. in october, churchill returned to england and began writing the river war, an account of the campaign which was published in november ; it was at this time that he decided to leave the army. he was critical of kitcheners actions during the war, particularly the latters unmerciful treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of muhammad ahmads tomb in omdurman.on  december , churchill embarked for india to settle his military business and complete his resignation from the th hussars. he spent a lot of his time there playing polo, the only ball sport in which he was ever interested. having left the hussars, he sailed from bombay on  march , determined to launch a career in politics.

seeking a parliamentary career, churchill spoke at conservative meetings and was selected as one of the partys two parliamentary candidates for the june  byelection in oldham, lancashire. while campaigning in oldham, churchill referred to himself as a conservative and a tory democrat. although the oldham seats had previously been held by the conservatives, the result was a narrow liberal victory.anticipating the outbreak of the second boer war between britain and the boer republics, churchill sailed to south africa as a journalist for the morning post under the editorship of james nicol dunn. in october, he travelled to the conflict zone near ladysmith, then besieged by boer troops, before heading for colenso. after his train was derailed by boer artillery shelling, he was captured as a prisoner of war  and interned in a boer pow camp in pretoria. in december, churchill escaped from the prison and evaded his captors by stowing away aboard freight trains and hiding in a mine. he eventually made it to safety in portuguese east africa. his escape attracted much publicity.in january , he briefly rejoined the army as a lieutenant in the south african light horse regiment, joining redvers bullers fight to relieve the siege of ladysmith and take pretoria. he was among the first british troops into both places. he and his cousin, the charles spencerchurchill, th duke of marlborough, demanded and received the surrender of  boer prison camp guards. throughout the war, he had publicly chastised antiboer prejudices, calling for them to be treated with generosity and tolerance, and after the war he urged the british to be magnanimous in victory. in july, having resigned his lieutenancy, he returned to britain. his morning post despatches had been published as london to ladysmith via pretoria and had sold well.churchill rented a flat in londons mayfair, using it as his base for the next six years. he stood again as one of the conservative candidates at oldham in the october  general election, securing a narrow victory to become a member of parliament at age . in the same month, he published ian hamiltons march, a book about his south african experiences, which became the focus of a lecture tour in november through britain, america and canada. members of parliament were unpaid and the tour was a financial necessity. in america, churchill met mark twain, president mckinley and vice president theodore roosevelt; he did not get on well with roosevelt. later, in spring , he gave more lectures in paris, madrid and gibraltar.

in february , churchill took his seat in the house of commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread press coverage. he associated with a group of conservatives known as the hughligans, but he was critical of the conservative government on various issues, especially increases in army funding. he believed that additional military expenditure should go to the navy. this upset the conservative front bench but was supported by liberals, with whom he increasingly socialised, particularly liberal imperialists like h. h. asquith. in this context, churchill later wrote that he drifted steadily to the left of parliamentary politics. he privately considered the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a democratic or progressive wing to the conservative party, or alternately a central party to unite the conservatives and liberals.by , there was real division between churchill and the conservatives, largely because he opposed their promotion of economic protectionism. as a free trader, he took part in the foundation of the free food league. churchill sensed that the animosity of many party members would prevent him from gaining a cabinet position under a conservative government. the liberal party was then attracting growing support, and so his defection in  may also have been influenced by personal ambition. he increasingly voted with the liberals against the government. for example, he opposed an increase in military expenditure; he supported a liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions; and he opposed the introduction of tariffs on goods imported into the british empire, describing himself as a sober admirer of the principles of free trade. arthur balfours government announced protectionist legislation in october . two months later, incensed by churchills criticism of the government, the oldham conservative association informed him that it would not support his candidature at the next general election.in may , churchill opposed the governments proposed aliens bill, designed to curb jewish migration into britain. he stated that the bill would appeal to insular prejudice against foreigners, to racial prejudice against jews, and to labour prejudice against competition and expressed himself in favour of the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained. on  may , he crossed the floor, defecting from the conservatives to sit as a member of the liberal party in the house of commons.

as a liberal, churchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of john morley and david lloyd george. in december , balfour resigned as prime minister and king edward vii invited the liberal leader henry campbellbannerman to take his place. hoping to secure a working majority in the house of commons, campbellbannerman called a general election in january , which the liberals won. churchill won the manchester north west seat. in the same month, his biography of his father was published; he received an advance payment of ,. it was generally well received. it was also at this time that the first biography of churchill himself, written by the liberal alexander maccallum scott, was published.in the new government, churchill became undersecretary of state for the colonial office, a junior ministerial position that he had requested. he worked beneath the secretary of state for the colonies, victor bruce, th earl of elgin, and took edward marsh as his secretary; marsh remained churchills secretary for  years. churchills first task was helping to draft a constitution for the transvaal; and he helped oversee the formation of a government in the orange river colony. in dealing with southern africa, he sought to ensure equality between the british and the boers. he also announced a gradual phasing out of the use of chinese indentured labourers in south africa; he and the government decided that a sudden ban would cause too much upset in the colony and might damage the economy. he expressed concerns about the relations between european settlers and the black african population; after the zulu launched their bambatha rebellion in natal, churchill complained about the disgusting butchery of the natives by europeans.

asquith succeeded the terminally ill campbellbannerman on  april  and, four days later, churchill was appointed president of the board of trade, succeeding lloyd george who became chancellor of the exchequer. aged , churchill was the youngest cabinet member since . newly appointed cabinet ministers were legally obliged to seek reelection at a byelection and on  april, churchill lost the manchester north west byelection to the conservative candidate by  votes. on  may, the liberals stood him in the safe seat of dundee, where he won comfortably.in private life, churchill proposed marriage to clementine hozier; they were married on  september  at st margarets, westminster and honeymooned in baveno, venice, and veveří castle in moravia. they lived at  eccleston square, london, and their first daughter, diana, was born in july . churchill and clementine were married for over  years until his death. the success of his marriage was important to churchills career as clementines unbroken affection provided him with a secure and happy background.one of churchills first tasks as a minister was to arbitrate in an industrial dispute among shipworkers and employers on the river tyne. he afterwards established a standing court of arbitration to deal with future industrial disputes, establishing a reputation as a conciliator. in cabinet, he worked with lloyd george to champion social reform. he promoted what he called a network of state intervention and regulation akin to that in germany.continuing lloyd georges work, churchill introduced the mines eight hours bill, which legally prohibited miners from working more than an eighthour day. in , he introduced the trade boards bill, creating trade boards which could prosecute exploitative employers. passing with a large majority, it established the principle of a minimum wage and the right of workers to have meal breaks. in may , he proposed the labour exchanges bill to establish over  labour exchanges through which the unemployed would be assisted in finding employment. he also promoted the idea of an unemployment insurance scheme, which would be partfunded by the state.to ensure funding for their reforms, lloyd george and churchill denounced reginald mckennas policy of naval expansion, refusing to believe that war with germany was inevitable. as chancellor, lloyd george presented his peoples budget on  april , calling it a war budget to eliminate poverty. with churchill as his closest ally, lloyd george proposed unprecedented taxes on the rich to fund the liberal welfare programmes. the budget was vetoed by the conservative peers who dominated the house of lords. his social reforms under threat, churchill became president of the budget league, and warned that upperclass obstruction could anger workingclass britons and lead to class war. the government called the january  general election, which resulted in a narrow liberal victory; churchill retained his seat at dundee. after the election, he proposed the abolition of the house of lords in a cabinet memorandum, suggesting that it be succeeded either by a unicameral system or by a new, smaller second chamber that lacked an inbuilt advantage for the conservatives. in april, the lords relented and the peoples budget passed into law. churchill continued to campaign against the house of lords and assisted passage of the parliament act  which reduced and restricted its powers.

in february , churchill was promoted to home secretary, giving him control over the police and prison services; he implemented a prison reform programme. measures included a distinction between criminal and political prisoners, with prison rules for the latter being relaxed. there were educational innovations like the establishment of libraries for prisoners, and a requirement for each prison to stage entertainments four times a year. the rules on solitary confinement were relaxed somewhat, and churchill proposed the abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines. imprisonment of people aged between  and  was abolished except for the most serious offences. churchill reduced   of the  death  sentences passed while he was home secretary.one of the major domestic issues in britain was womens suffrage. churchill supported giving women the vote, but he would only back a bill to that effect if it had majority support from the  electorate. his proposed solution was a referendum on the issue, but this found no favour with asquith and womens suffrage remained unresolved until . many suffragettes believed that churchill was a committed opponent of womens suffrage, and targeted his meetings for protest. in november , the suffragist hugh franklin attacked churchill with a whip; franklin was arrested and imprisoned for six weeks.

in november , churchill had to deal with the tonypandy riots, in which coal miners in the rhondda valley violently protested against their working conditions. the chief constable of glamorgan requested troops to help police quell the rioting. churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them to go as far as swindon and cardiff, but blocked their deployment; he was concerned that the use of troops could lead to bloodshed. instead he sent  london police, who were not equipped with firearms, to assist their welsh counterparts. as the riots continued, he offered the protesters an interview with the governments chief industrial arbitrator, which they accepted. privately, churchill regarded both the mine owners and striking miners as being very unreasonable. the times and other media outlets accused him of being too soft on the rioters; in contrast, many in the labour party, which was linked to the trade unions, regarded him as having been too heavyhanded. in consequence of the latter, churchill incurred the longterm suspicion of the labour movement.asquith called a general election in december  and the liberals were reelected with churchill secure in dundee. in january , churchill became involved in the siege of sidney street; three latvian burglars had killed several police officers and hidden in a house in the east end of london, which was surrounded by police. churchill stood with the police though he did not direct their operation. after the house caught fire, he told the fire brigade not to proceed into the house because of the threat posed by the armed men. afterwards, two of the burglars were found dead. although he faced criticism for his decision, he stated that he thought it better to let the house burn down rather than spend good british lives in rescuing those ferocious rascals.in march , churchill introduced the second reading of the coal mines bill in parliament. when implemented, it imposed stricter safety standards at coal mines. he also formulated the shops bill to improve the working conditions of shop workers; it faced opposition from shop owners and only passed into law in a much emasculated form. in april, lloyd george introduced the first health and unemployment insurance legislation, the national insurance act , which churchill had been instrumental in drafting. in may, clementine gave birth to their second child, randolph, named after churchills father. in response to escalating civil strife in , churchill sent troops into liverpool to quell protesting dockers and rallied against a national railway strike.during the agadir crisis of april , when there was a threat of war between france and germany, churchill suggested an alliance with france and russia to safeguard the independence of belgium, denmark and the netherlands to counter possible german expansionism. the agadir crisis had a profound effect on churchill and he altered his views about the need for naval expansion.

in october , asquith appointed churchill first lord of the admiralty, and he took up official residence at admiralty house. he created a naval war staff and, over the next two and a half years, focused on naval preparation, visiting naval stations and dockyards, seeking to improve morale, and scrutinising german naval developments. after the german government passed its  naval law to increase warship production, churchill vowed that britain would do the same and that for every new battleship built by the germans, britain would build two. he invited germany to engage in a mutual deescalation of naval building projects, but this was refused.churchill pushed for higher pay and greater recreational facilities for naval staff, an increase in the building of submarines, and a renewed focus on the royal naval air service, encouraging them to experiment with how aircraft could be used for military purposes. he coined the term seaplane and ordered  to be constructed. some liberals objected to his levels of naval expenditure; in december  he threatened to resign if his proposal for four new battleships in  was rejected. in june , he convinced the house of commons to authorise the government purchase of a  percent share in the profits of oil produced by the anglopersian oil company, to secure continued oil access for the royal navy.the central issue in britain at the time was irish home rule and, in , asquiths government introduced the home rule bill. churchill supported it and urged ulster unionists to accept it as he opposed the partition of ireland. concerning the possibility of the partition of ireland, churchill stated whatever ulsters right may be, she cannot stand in the way of the whole of the rest of ireland. half a province cannot impose a permanent veto on the nation. half a province cannot obstruct forever the reconciliation between the british and irish democracies. speaking in the house of commons on  february , churchill said what irishmen all over the world most desire is not hostility against this country, but the unity of their own. 

later, following a cabinet decision, he boosted the naval presence in ireland to deal with any unionist uprising. seeking a compromise, churchill suggested that ireland remain part of a federal united kingdom but this angered liberals and irish nationalists.as first lord, churchill was tasked with overseeing britains naval effort when the first world war began in august . in the same month, the navy transported , british troops to france and began a blockade of germanys north sea ports. churchill sent submarines to the baltic sea to assist the russian navy and he sent the marine brigade to ostend, forcing a reallocation of german troops. in september, churchill assumed full responsibility for britains aerial defence. on  october, clementine gave birth to their third child, sarah. in october, churchill visited antwerp to observe belgian defences against the besieging germans and promised british reinforcements for the city. soon afterwards, however, antwerp fell to the germans and churchill was criticised in the press. he maintained that his actions had prolonged resistance and enabled the allies to secure calais and dunkirk. in november, asquith called a war council, consisting of himself, lloyd george, edward grey, kitchener, and churchill. churchill set the development of the tank on the right track and financed its creation with admiralty funds.churchill was interested in the middle eastern theatre and wanted to relieve turkish pressure on the russians in the caucasus by staging attacks against turkey in the dardanelles. he hoped that, if successful, the british could even seize constantinople. approval was given and, in march , an anglofrench task force attempted a naval bombardment of turkish defences in the dardanelles. in april, the mediterranean expeditionary force, including the australian and new zealand army corps , began its assault at gallipoli. both campaigns failed and churchill was held by many mps, particularly conservatives, to be personally responsible.in may, asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an allparty coalition government, but the conservatives one condition of entry was that churchill must be removed from the admiralty. churchill pleaded his case with both asquith and conservative leader bonar law but had to accept demotion and became chancellor of the duchy of lancaster.

on  november , churchill resigned from the government, although he remained an mp. asquith rejected his request to be appointed governorgeneral of british east africa.churchill decided to return to active service with the army and was attached to the nd grenadier guards, on the western front. in january , he was temporarily promoted to lieutenantcolonel and given command of the th royal scots fusiliers. after a period of training, the battalion was moved to a sector of the belgian front near ploegsteert. for over three months, they faced continual shelling although no german offensive. churchill narrowly escaped death when, during a visit by his staff officer cousin the th duke of marlborough, a large piece of shrapnel fell between them. in may, the th royal scots fusiliers were merged into the th division. churchill did not request a new command, instead securing permission to leave active service. his temporary promotion ended on  may , when he returned to the rank of major.back in the house of commons, churchill spoke out on war issues, calling for conscription to be extended to the irish, greater recognition of soldiers bravery, and for the introduction of steel helmets for troops. it was in november  that he penned the greater application of mechanical power to the prosecution of an offensive on land, but it fell on deaf ears. he was frustrated at being out of office as a backbencher, but he was repeatedly blamed for gallipoli, mainly by the proconservative press. churchill argued his case before the dardanelles commission, whose published report placed no blame on him personally for the campaigns failure.

in october , asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by lloyd george who, in may , sent churchill to inspect the french war effort. in july, churchill was appointed minister of munitions. he quickly negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the clyde and increased munitions production. it was in his october  letter to the attention of his cabinet colleagues that he penned the plan of attack for the next year that would bring final victory to the allies. he ended a second strike, in june , by threatening to conscript strikers into the army. in the house of commons, churchill voted in support of the representation of the people act , which gave some british women the right to vote. in november , four days after the armistice, churchills fourth child, marigold, was born.

with the war over, lloyd george called a general election with voting on saturday,  december . during the election campaign, churchill called for the nationalisation of the railways, a control on monopolies, tax reform, and the creation of a league of nations to prevent future wars. he was returned as mp for dundee and, although the conservatives won a majority, lloyd george was retained as prime minister. in january , lloyd george moved churchill to the war office as both secretary of state for war and secretary of state for air.churchill was responsible for demobilising the british army, although he convinced lloyd george to keep a million men conscripted for the british army of the rhine. churchill was one of the few government figures who opposed harsh measures against the defeated germany, and he cautioned against demobilising the german army, warning that they might be needed as a bulwark against threats from the newly established soviet russia. he was an outspoken opponent of vladimir lenins new communist party government in russia. he initially supported the use of british troops to assist the anticommunist white forces in the russian civil war, but soon recognised the desire of the british people to bring them home. after the soviets won the civil war, churchill proposed a cordon sanitaire around the country.in the irish war of independence, he supported the use of the paramilitary black and tans to combat irish revolutionaries. after british troops in iraq clashed with kurdish rebels, churchill authorised two squadrons to the area, proposing that they be equipped with poison gas to be used to inflict punishment upon recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury upon them, although this was never implemented. there is debate as to whether this would have included mustard gas or otherwise lacrimatory gas . more broadly, he saw the occupation of iraq as a drain on britain and proposed, unsuccessfully, that the government should hand control of central and northern iraq back to turkey.

 churchill became secretary of state for the colonies in february . the following month, the first exhibit of his paintings was held; it took place in paris, with churchill exhibiting under a pseudonym. in may, his mother died; followed in august by his twoyearold daughter marigold who died from septicaemia. marigolds death devastated her parents and churchill was haunted by the tragedy for the rest of his life.churchill was involved in negotiations with sinn féin leaders and helped draft the angloirish treaty. elsewhere, he was responsible for reducing the cost of occupying the middle east, and was involved in the installations of faisal i of iraq and his brother abdullah i of jordan. churchill travelled to mandatory palestine where, as a supporter of zionism, he refused an arab palestinian petition to prohibit jewish migration to palestine. he did allow some temporary restrictions following the  jaffa riots.in september , the chanak crisis erupted as turkish forces threatened to occupy the dardanelles neutral zone, which was policed by the british army based in chanak . churchill and lloyd george favoured military resistance to any turkish advance but the majority conservatives in the coalition government opposed it. a political debacle ensued which resulted in the conservative withdrawal from the government, precipitating the november  general election.also in september, churchills fifth and last child, mary, was born, and in the same month he purchased chartwell, in kent, which became his family home for the rest of his lifetime. in october , he underwent an operation for appendicitis. while he was in hospital, lloyd georges coalition was dissolved. in the general election, churchill lost his dundee seat  to edwin scrymgeour, a prohibitionist candidate. later, he wrote that he was without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix. still, he could be satisfied with his elevation as one of  companions of honour, as named in lloyd georges  dissolution honours list.

churchill spent much of the next six months at the villa rêve dor near cannes, where he devoted himself to painting and writing his memoirs. he wrote an autobiographical history of the war, the world crisis. the first volume was published in april  and the rest over the next ten years.after the  general election was called, seven liberal associations asked churchill to stand as their candidate, and he selected leicester west, but he did not win the seat. a labour government led by ramsay macdonald took power. churchill had hoped they would be defeated by a conservativeliberal coalition. he strongly opposed the macdonald governments decision to loan money to soviet russia and feared the signing of an anglosoviet treaty.on  march , alienated by liberal support for labour, churchill stood as an independent antisocialist candidate in the westminster abbey byelection but was defeated. in may, he addressed a conservative meeting in liverpool and declared that there was no longer a place for the liberal party in british politics. he said that liberals must back the conservatives to stop labour and ensure the successful defeat of socialism. in july, he agreed with conservative leader stanley baldwin that he would be selected as a conservative candidate in the next general election, which was held on  october. churchill stood at epping, but he described himself as a constitutionalist. the conservatives were victorious, and baldwin formed the new government. although churchill had no background in finance or economics, baldwin appointed him as chancellor of the exchequer.

becoming chancellor on  november , churchill formally rejoined the conservative party. as chancellor, he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of laissezfaire economics, as under the liberal social reforms. in april , he controversially albeit reluctantly restored the gold standard in his first budget at its  parity against the advice of some leading economists including john maynard keynes. the return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry. churchill presented five budgets in all to april . among his measures were reduction of the state pension age from  to ; immediate provision of widows pensions; reduction of military expenditure; income tax reductions and imposition of taxes on luxury items.during the general strike of , churchill edited the british gazette, the governments antistrike propaganda newspaper. after the strike ended, he acted as an intermediary between striking miners and their employers. he later called for the introduction of a legally binding minimum wage. in a house of commons speech in  churchill made his unique feelings on the issue of irish unity clear. he stated that ireland should be united within itself but also united to the british empire. in early , churchill visited rome where he met mussolini, whom he praised for his stand against leninism.

in the  general election, churchill retained his epping seat, but the conservatives were defeated, and macdonald formed his second labour government. out of office, churchill was prone to depression  as he sensed his political talents being wasted and time passing him by  in all such times, writing provided the antidote. he began work on marlborough his life and times, a fourvolume biography of his ancestor john churchill, st duke of marlborough. it was by this time that he had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker of alcoholic beverages, although jenkins believes that was often exaggerated.hoping that the labour government could be ousted, he gained baldwins approval to work towards establishing a conservativeliberal coalition, although many liberals were reluctant. in october , after his return from a trip to north america, churchill published his autobiography, my early life, which sold well and was translated into multiple languages.in january , churchill resigned from the conservative shadow cabinet because baldwin supported the decision of the labour government to grant dominion status to india. churchill believed that enhanced home rule status would hasten calls for full independence. he was particularly opposed to mohandas gandhi, whom he considered a seditious middle temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir. his views enraged labour and liberal opinion although he was supported by many grassroot conservatives.the october  general election was a landslide victory for the conservatives churchill nearly doubled his majority in epping, but he was not given a ministerial position. the commons debated dominion status for india on  december and churchill insisted on dividing the house, but this backfired as only  mps supported him. he embarked on a lecture tour of north america, hoping to recoup financial losses sustained in the wall street crash. on  december, he was crossing fifth avenue in new york city when he was knocked down by a car, suffering a head wound from which he developed neuritis. to further his convalescence, he and clementine took ship to nassau for three weeks but churchill became depressed there about his financial and political losses. he returned to america in late january  and completed most of his lectures before arriving home on  march.having worked on marlborough for much of , churchill in late august decided to visit his ancestors battlefields. staying at the regina hotel in munich, he met ernst hanfstaengl, a friend of hitler, who was then rising in prominence. hanfstaengl tried to arrange a meeting between churchill and hitler, but hitler was unenthusiastic what on earth would i talk to him about he asked. after churchill raised concerns about hitlers antisemitism, hitler did not come to the hotel that day or the next. hitler allegedly told hanfstaengl that churchill was not in office and was of no consequence. soon after visiting blenheim, churchill was affected by paratyphoid fever and spent two weeks at a sanatorium in salzburg. he returned to chartwell on  september, still working on marlborough. two days later, he collapsed while walking in the grounds after a recurrence of paratyphoid which caused an ulcer to haemorrhage. he was taken to a london nursing home and remained there until late october.

after hitler came to power on  january , churchill was quick to recognise the menace of such a regime and expressed alarm that the british government had reduced air force spending and warned that germany would soon overtake britain in air force production. armed with official data provided clandestinely by two senior civil servants, desmond morton and ralph wigram, churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in germany, especially the development of the luftwaffe. he told the people of his concerns in a radio broadcast in november , having earlier denounced the intolerance and militarism of nazism in the house of commons. while churchill regarded mussolinis regime as a bulwark against the perceived threat of communist revolution, he opposed the italian invasion of ethiopia, despite describing the country as a primitive, uncivilised nation. writing about the spanish civil war, he referred to francos army as the antired movement, but later became critical of franco. two of his nephews, esmond and giles romilly, fought as volunteers in the international brigades in defence of the legitimate republican government.between october  and september , the four volumes of marlborough his life and times were published and sold well. in december , the india bill entered parliament and was passed in february . churchill and  other conservative mps voted against it. in june , macdonald resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by baldwin. baldwin then led the conservatives to victory in the  general election; churchill retained his seat with an increased majority but was again left out of the government.in january , edward viii succeeded his father, george v, as monarch. his desire to marry an american divorcee, wallis simpson, caused the abdication crisis. churchill supported edward and clashed with baldwin on the issue. afterwards, although churchill immediately pledged loyalty to george vi, he wrote that the abdication was premature and probably quite unnecessary.

in may , baldwin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by neville chamberlain. at first, churchill welcomed chamberlains appointment but, in february , matters came to a head after foreign secretary anthony eden resigned over chamberlains appeasement of mussolini, a policy which chamberlain was extending towards hitler.in , churchill warned the government against appeasement and called for collective action to deter german aggression. in march, the evening standard ceased publication of his fortnightly articles, but the daily telegraph published them instead. following the german annexation of austria, churchill spoke in the house of commons, declaring that the gravity of the events... cannot be exaggerated...

a country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose defence has been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. war will be avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor.

he began calling for a mutual defence pact among european states threatened by german expansionism, arguing that this was the only way to halt hitler. this was to no avail as, in september, germany mobilised to invade the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. churchill visited chamberlain at downing street and urged him to tell germany that britain would declare war if the germans invaded czechoslovak territory; chamberlain was not willing to do this. on  september, chamberlain signed up to the munich agreement, agreeing to allow german annexation of the sudetenland. speaking in the house of commons on  october, churchill called the agreement a total and unmitigated defeat. following the final dismemberment of czechoslovakia in march , churchill and his supporters called for the foundation of a national coalition. his popularity increased and people began to agitate for his return to office.

on  september , the day britain declared war on germany, chamberlain reappointed churchill as first lord of the admiralty and he joined chamberlains war cabinet. churchill later claimed that the board of the admiralty sent a signal to the fleet winston is back. as first lord, churchill was one of the highestprofile ministers during the socalled phoney war, when the only significant action by british forces was at sea. churchill was ebullient after the battle of the river plate on  december  and afterwards welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on a brilliant sea fight and saying that their actions in a cold, dark winter had warmed the cockles of the british heart. on  february , churchill personally ordered captain philip vian of the destroyer hms cossack to board the german supply ship altmark in norwegian waters freeing  british merchant seamen who had been captured by the admiral graf spee. these actions, supplemented by his speeches, considerably enhanced churchills reputation.he was concerned about german naval activity in the baltic sea and initially wanted to send a naval force there but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed operation wilfred, to mine norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from narvik to germany. there were disagreements about mining, both in the war cabinet and with the french government. as a result, wilfred was delayed until  april , the day before the german invasion of norway was launched.

after the allies failed to prevent the german occupation of norway, the commons held an open debate from  to  may on the governments conduct of the war. this has come to be known as the norway debate and is renowned as one of the most significant events in parliamentary history. on the second day , the labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in chamberlains government. there was considerable support for churchill on both sides of the house but, as a member of the government, he was obliged to speak on its behalf. he was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige. although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.in the early hours of  may, german forces invaded belgium, luxembourg and the netherlands as a prelude to their assault on france. since the division vote, chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but labour declared on the friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another conservative. the only two candidates were churchill and lord halifax, the foreign secretary. the matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the th between chamberlain, halifax, churchill, and david margesson, the government chief whip. halifax admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the house of lords and so chamberlain advised the king to send for churchill, who became prime minister. churchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene. he believed himself to be walking with destiny and that his life so far had been a preparation for this hour and for this trial.

in may, churchill was still generally unpopular with many conservatives and probably most of the labour party. chamberlain remained conservative party leader until october when ill health forced his resignation. by that time, churchill had won the doubters over and his succession as party leader was a formality.he began his premiership by forming a fiveman war cabinet which included chamberlain as lord president of the council, labour leader clement attlee as lord privy seal , halifax as foreign secretary and labours arthur greenwood as a minister without portfolio. in practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings. the cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, one of the key appointments being the leading trades unionist ernest bevin as minister of labour and national service. in response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, churchill created and assumed the additional position of minister of defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in british history. he drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the home front. these included personal friends like lord beaverbrook and frederick lindemann, who became the governments scientific advisor.

at the end of may, with the british expeditionary force in retreat to dunkirk and the fall of france seemingly imminent, halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using the stillneutral mussolini as an intermediary. there were several highlevel meetings from  to  may, including two with the french premier paul reynaud. churchills resolve was to fight on, even if france capitulated, but his position remained precarious until chamberlain resolved to support him. churchill had the full support of the two labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both chamberlain and halifax were against him. in the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, churchill outmanoeuvred halifax and won chamberlain over. churchill believed that the only option was to fight on and his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the british people for a long war  jenkins says churchills speeches were an inspiration for the nation, and a catharsis for churchill himself.churchill succeeded as an orator despite being handicapped from childhood with a speech impediment. he had a lateral lisp and was unable to pronounce the letter s, verbalising it with a slur. he worked hard on his pronunciation by repeating phrases designed to cure his problem with the sibilant s. he was ultimately successful and was eventually able to say my impediment is no hindrance. in time, he turned the impediment into an asset and could use it to great effect, as when he called hitler a narzee , rather than a nazi .his first speech as prime minister, delivered to the commons on  may was the blood, toil, tears and sweat speech. it was little more than a short statement but, jenkins says, it included phrases which have reverberated down the decades. churchill made it plain to the nation that a long, hard road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal

i would say to the house... that i have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. you ask, what is our policy i will say it is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. that is our policy. you ask, what is our aim i can answer in one word it is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.

operation dynamo, the evacuation of , allied servicemen from dunkirk, ended on tuesday,  june when the french rearguard surrendered. the total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory. churchill himself referred to a miracle of deliverance in his we shall fight on the beaches speech to the commons that afternoon, though he shortly reminded everyone that we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. wars are not won by evacuations. the speech ended on a note of defiance coupled with a clear appeal to the united states

we shall go on to the end. we shall fight in france, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. we shall never surrender, and even if, which i do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the british fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in gods good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

germany initiated fall rot the following day and italy entered the war on the th. the wehrmacht occupied paris on the th and completed their conquest of france on  june. it was now inevitable that hitler would attack and probably try to invade great britain. faced with this, churchill addressed the commons on  june and delivered one of his most famous speeches, ending with this peroration

what general weygand called the battle of france is over. i expect that the battle of britain is about to begin. hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the british commonwealth and empire lasts for a thousand years, men will still say this was their finest hour.

churchill was determined to fight back and ordered the commencement of the western desert campaign on  june, an immediate response to the italian declaration of war. this went well at first while the italian army was the sole opposition and operation compass was a noted success. in early , however, mussolini requested german support and hitler sent the afrika korps to tripoli under the command of generalleutnant erwin rommel, who arrived not long after churchill had halted compass so that he could reassign forces to greece where the balkans campaign was entering a critical phase.in other initiatives through june and july , churchill ordered the formation of both the special operations executive  and the commandos. the soe was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in nazioccupied europe while the commandos were charged with raids on specific military targets there. hugh dalton, the minister of economic warfare, took political responsibility for the soe and recorded in his diary that churchill told him and now go and set europe ablaze.

on  august , at the height of the battle of britain, churchill addressed the commons to outline the war situation. in the middle of this speech, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the raf fighter pilots involved in the battle

the gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the british airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion. never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.

the luftwaffe altered its strategy from  september  and began the blitz, which was especially intensive through october and november. churchills morale during the blitz was generally high and he told his private secretary john colville in november that he thought the threat of invasion was past. he was confident that great britain could hold its own, given the increase in output, but was realistic about its chances of actually winning the war without american intervention.

in september , the british and american governments concluded the destroyers for bases agreement, by which fifty american destroyers were transferred to the royal navy in exchange for free us base rights in bermuda, the caribbean and newfoundland. an added advantage for britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere.churchills good relations with united states president franklin d. roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the north atlantic shipping routes. it was for this reason that churchill was relieved when roosevelt was reelected in . upon reelection, roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to great britain without the need for monetary payment. he persuaded congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the us. the policy was known as lendlease and it was formally enacted on  march .

hitler launched his invasion of the soviet union on sunday,  june . it was no surprise to churchill, who had known since early april, from enigma decrypts at bletchley park, that the attack was imminent. he had tried to warn general secretary joseph stalin via the british ambassador to moscow, stafford cripps, but to no avail as stalin did not trust churchill. the night before the attack, already intending an address to the nation, churchill alluded to his hitherto anticommunist views by saying to colville if hitler invaded hell, i would at least make a favourable reference to the devil.

in august , churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board hms prince of wales and met roosevelt in placentia bay, newfoundland. on  august, they issued the joint statement that has become known as the atlantic charter. this outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and it is seen as the inspiration for the  declaration by united nations, itself the basis of the united nations which was founded in june .

on  december , the japanese attack on pearl harbor was followed by their invasion of malaya and, on the th, churchill declared war on japan. with the hope of using irish ports for counter submarine operations, churchill sent a telegram to the irish prime minister  in which he obliquely offers irish unity now is your chance. now or never a nation once again i will meet you wherever you wish. no meeting took place between the two prime ministers and there is no record of a response from the irish prime minister éamon de valera three days later came the joint declaration of war by germany and italy against the united states. churchill went to washington later in the month to meet roosevelt for the first washington conference . this was important for europe first, the decision to prioritise victory in europe over victory in the pacific, taken by roosevelt while churchill was still in midatlantic. the americans agreed with churchill that hitler was the main enemy and that the defeat of germany was key to allied success. it was also agreed that the first joint angloamerican strike would be operation torch, the invasion of french north africa . originally planned for the spring of , it was finally launched in november  when the crucial second battle of el alamein was already underway.on  december, churchill addressed a joint meeting of the us congress but, that night, he suffered a mild heart attack which was diagnosed by his physician, sir charles wilson , as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks bed rest. churchill insisted that he did not need bed rest and, two days later, journeyed on to ottawa by train where he gave a speech to the canadian parliament that included the some chicken, some neck line in which he recalled french predictions in  that britain alone would have her neck wrung like a chicken. he arrived home in midjanuary, having flown from bermuda to plymouth in a boeing  clipper , to find that there was a crisis of confidence in both his coalition government and himself personally, and he decided to face a vote of confidence in the commons, which he won easily.while he was away, the eighth army, having already relieved the siege of tobruk, had pursued operation crusader against rommels forces in libya, successfully driving them back to a defensive position at el agheila in cyrenaica. on  january , however, rommel launched a surprise counterattack which drove the allies back to gazala.

elsewhere, recent british success in the battle of the atlantic was compromised by the kriegsmarines introduction of its m rotor enigma, whose signals could not be deciphered by bletchley park for nearly a year. in the far east, the news was much worse with japanese advances in all theatres, especially at sea and in malaya. at a press conference in washington, churchill had to play down his increasing doubts about the security of singapore.

churchill already had grave concerns about the fighting quality of british troops after the defeats in norway, france, greece and crete. following the fall of singapore to the japanese on  february , he felt that his misgivings were confirmed and said  the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british military history. more bad news had come on  february as the kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious channel dash, a massive blow to british naval prestige. the combined effect of these events was to sink churchills morale to its lowest point of the whole war.meanwhile, the japanese had occupied most of burma by the end of april . counteroffensives were hampered by the monsoon season and by disordered conditions in bengal and bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in october . a combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and a series of largescale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the bengal famine of , in which an estimated .. million people died. from december  onwards, food shortages had prompted senior officials in india to ask london for grain imports, although the colonial authorities failed to recognise the seriousness of the emerging famine and responded ineptly. churchills government was criticised for refusing to approve more imports, a policy it ascribed to an acute wartime shortage of shipping. when the british realised the full extent of the famine in september , churchill ordered the transportation of , tons of iraqi and australian grain to bengal and the war cabinet agreed to send , tons by the end of the year. during the last quarter of , , tons of rice and , tons of wheat were imported, compared to averages of , tons of rice and , tons of wheat earlier in the year. in october, churchill wrote to the newly appointed viceroy of india, lord wavell, charging him with the responsibility of ending the famine. in february , as preparation for operation overlord placed greater demands on allied shipping, churchill cabled wavell saying i will certainly help you all i can, but you must not ask the impossible. grain shipment requests continued to be turned down by the government throughout , and wavell complained to churchill in october that the vital problems of india are being treated by his majestys government with neglect, even sometimes with hostility and contempt. the relative impact of british policies on the death toll of the famine remains a matter of controversy among scholars.

on  may , the soviet foreign affairs minister, vyacheslav molotov, arrived in london and stayed until the th before going on to washington. the purpose of this visit was to sign a treaty of friendship but molotov wanted it done on the basis of certain territorial concessions regarding poland and the baltic countries. churchill and eden worked for a compromise and eventually a twentyyear treaty was formalised but with the question of frontiers placed on hold. molotov was also seeking a second front in europe but all churchill could do was confirm that preparations were in progress and make no promises on a date.churchill felt well pleased with these negotiations and said as much when he contacted roosevelt on the th. the previous day, however, rommel had launched his counteroffensive, operation venice, to begin the battle of gazala. the allies were ultimately driven out of libya and suffered a major defeat in the fall of tobruk on  june. churchill was with roosevelt when the news of tobruk reached him. he was shocked by the surrender of , troops which was, apart from singapore, the heaviest blow he received in the war. the axis advance was eventually halted at the first battle of el alamein in july and the battle of alam el halfa in early september. both sides were exhausted and in urgent need of reinforcements and supplies.churchill had returned to washington on  june. he and roosevelt agreed on the implementation of operation torch as the necessary precursor to an invasion of europe. roosevelt had appointed general dwight d. eisenhower as commanding officer of the european theater of operations, united states army . having received the news from north africa, churchill obtained shipment from america to the eighth army of  sherman tanks and  howitzers. he returned to britain on  june and had to face another motion of no confidence, this time in his central direction of the war, but again he won easily.in august, despite health concerns, churchill visited the british forces in north africa, raising morale in the process, en route to moscow for his first meeting with stalin. he was accompanied by roosevelts special envoy averell harriman. he was in moscow  august and had four lengthy meetings with stalin. although they got along quite well together on a personal level, there was little chance of any real progress given the state of the war with the germans still advancing in all theatres. stalin was desperate for the allies to open the second front in europe, as churchill had discussed with molotov in may, and the answer was the same.

while he was in cairo in early august, churchill decided to appoint field marshal alexander as field marshal auchinlecks successor as commanderinchief of the middle east theatre. command of the eighth army was given to general william gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to cairo, only three days later and general montgomery succeeded him. churchill returned to cairo from moscow on  august and could see for himself that the alexander/montgomery combination was already having an effect. he returned to england on the st, nine days before rommel launched his final offensive.

as  drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with allied victory in the key battles of el alamein and stalingrad. until november, the allies had always been on the defensive, but from november, the germans were. churchill ordered the church bells to be rung throughout great britain for the first time since early . on  november, knowing that el alamein was a victory, he delivered one of his most memorable war speeches to the lord mayors luncheon at the mansion house in london, in response to the allied victory at el alamein this is not the end. it is not even the beginning of the end. but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

in january , churchill met roosevelt at the casablanca conference , which lasted ten days. it was also attended by general charles de gaulle on behalf of the free french forces. stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of the situation at stalingrad. although churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the socalled casablanca declaration committed the allies to securing unconditional surrender by the axis powers. from morocco, churchill went to cairo, adana, cyprus, cairo again and algiers for various purposes. he arrived home on  february having been out of the country for nearly a month. he addressed the commons on the th and then became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than one month of rest, recuperation and convalescence  for the latter, he moved to chequers. he returned to work in london on  march.churchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year, meeting roosevelt at both the third washington conference  in may and the first quebec conference  in august. in november, churchill and roosevelt met chinese generalissimo chiang kaishek at the cairo conference .the most important conference of the year was soon afterwards  at tehran , where churchill and roosevelt met stalin in the first of the big three meetings, preceding those at yalta and potsdam in . roosevelt and stalin cooperated in persuading churchill to commit to the opening of a second front in western europe and it was also agreed that germany would be divided after the war, but no firm decisions were made about how. on their way back from tehran, churchill and roosevelt held a second cairo conference with turkish president i̇smet i̇nönü, but were unable to gain any commitment from turkey to join the allies.churchill went from cairo to tunis, arriving on  december, initially as eisenhowers guest . while churchill was in tunis, he became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain until after christmas while a succession of specialists was drafted in to ensure his recovery. clementine and colville arrived to keep him company; colville had just returned to downing street after more than two years in the raf. on  december, the party went on to marrakesh for convalescence. feeling much better, churchill flew to gibraltar on  january  and sailed home on the king george v. he was back in london on the morning of  january and surprised mps by attending prime ministers questions in the commons that afternoon. since  january , when he set off for the casablanca conference, churchill had been abroad or seriously ill for  of the  days.

in the autumn of , after churchills meeting with stalin in moscow, he was approached by eisenhower, commanding the north african theater of operations, united states army , and his aides on the subject of where the western allies should launch their first strike in europe. according to general mark clark, who later commanded the united states fifth army in the italian campaign, the americans openly admitted that a crosschannel operation in the near future was utterly impossible. as an alternative, churchill recommended slit the soft belly of the mediterranean and persuaded them to invade first sicily and then italy after they had defeated the afrika korps in north africa. after the war, clark still agreed that churchills analysis was correct, but he added that, when the allies landed at salerno, they found that italy was a tough old gut.the invasion of sicily began on  july and was successfully completed by  august. churchill was then all for driving straight up the italian mainland with rome as the main target, but the americans wanted to withdraw several divisions to england in the buildup of forces for operation overlord, now scheduled for the spring of . churchill was still not keen on overlord as he feared that an angloamerican army in france might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the wehrmacht. he preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called operation jupiter for an invasion of northern norway. events in sicily had an unexpected impact in italy. king victor emmanuel sacked mussolini on  july and appointed marshal badoglio as prime minister. badoglio opened negotiations with the allies which resulted in the armistice of cassibile on  september. in response, the germans activated operation achse and took control of most of italy. although he still preferred italy to normandy as the allies main route into the third reich, churchill was deeply concerned about the strong german resistance at salerno and, later, after the allies successfully gained their bridgehead at anzio but still failed to break the stalemate, he caustically said that instead of hurling a wildcat onto the shore, the allied force had become a stranded whale.  the big obstacle was monte cassino and it was not until midmay  when it was finally overcome, enabling the allies to at last advance on rome, which was taken on  june.

the difficulties in italy caused churchill to have a change of heart and mind about allied strategy to the extent that, when the anzio stalemate developed soon after his return to england from north africa, he threw himself into the planning of overlord and set up an ongoing series of meetings with shaef and the british chiefs of staff over which he regularly presided. these were always attended by either eisenhower or his chief of staff general walter bedell smith. churchill was especially taken by the mulberry project but he was also keen to make the most of allied air power which, by the beginning of , had become overwhelming. churchill never fully lost his apprehension about the invasion, however, and underwent great fluctuation of mood as dday approached. jenkins says that he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier.

churchill could not ignore the need for postwar reforms covering a broad sweep of areas such as agriculture, education, employment, health, housing and welfare. the beveridge report with its five giant evils was published in november  and assumed great importance amid widespread popular acclaim. even so, churchill was not really interested because he was focused on winning the war and saw reform in terms of tidying up afterwards. his attitude was demonstrated in a sunday evening radio broadcast on  march . he was obliged to devote most of it to the subject of reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. in their respective diaries, colville said churchill had broadcast indifferently and harold nicolson said that, to many people, churchill came across the air as a worn and petulant old man.in the end, however, it was the populations demand for reform that decided the  general election. labour was perceived as the party that would deliver beveridge. arthur greenwood had initiated its preceding social insurance and allied services inquiry in june . attlee, bevin and labours other coalition ministers through the war were seen to be working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate.

churchill was determined to be actively involved in the normandy invasion and hoped to cross the channel on dday itself  or at least on dday. his desire caused unnecessary consternation at shaef until he was effectively vetoed by the king who told churchill that, as head of all three services, he  ought to go too. churchill expected an allied death toll of , on dday but he was proven to be pessimistic because less than , died in the whole of june. he made his first visit to normandy on  june to visit montgomery, whose hq was then about five miles inland. that evening, as he was returning to london, the first v flying bombs were launched. in a longer visit to normandy on  july, churchill went to cherbourg and arromanches where he saw the mulberry harbour.

churchill met roosevelt at the second quebec conference  from  to  september . between themselves, they reached agreement on the morgenthau plan for the allied occupation of germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also deindustrialise germany. eden strongly opposed it and was later able to persuade churchill to disown it. us secretary of state cordell hull also opposed it and convinced roosevelt that it was infeasible.

at the fourth moscow conference  from  to  october , churchill and eden met stalin and molotov. this conference has gained notoriety for the socalled percentages agreement in which churchill and stalin effectively agreed the postwar fate of the balkans. by that time, the soviet armies were in rumania and bulgaria. churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, get at crosspurposes in small ways. he wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to stalin who ticked it. the agreement was that russia would have  control of romania and  control of bulgaria. the united kingdom and the united states would have  control of greece. hungary and yugoslavia would be  each. in , five years after the account of this meeting was published , soviet authorities denied that stalin had accepted such an imperialist proposal.

from  january to  february , churchill and roosevelt met for their malta conference ahead of the second big three event at yalta from  to  february. yalta had massive implications for the postwar world. there were two predominant issues the question of setting up the united nations organisation after the war, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of polands postwar status, which churchill saw as a test case for the future of eastern europe. churchill faced some strong criticism for the yalta agreement on poland. for example,  tory mps voted against him when the matter was debated in the commons at the end of the month. jenkins, however, maintains that churchill did as well as he could have done in very difficult circumstances, not least the fact that roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide churchill with meaningful support.another outcome of yalta was the socalled operation keelhaul. the western allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all soviet citizens in the allied zones, including prisoners of war, to the soviet union and the policy was later extended to all eastern european refugees, many of whom were anticommunist. keelhaul was implemented between  august  and  may .

on the nights of  february , some , british and us bombers attacked the german city of dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the eastern front. the attacks were part of an area bombing campaign that was initiated by churchill in january with the intention of shortening the war. churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in  confirmed a death toll between , and ,. on  march, he decided to restrict area bombing and sent a memorandum to general ismay for the chiefs of staff committee

the destruction of dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of allied bombing..... i feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives..... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive.

british historian frederick taylor has pointed out that the number of soviet citizens who died from german bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of german citizens who died from allied raids. jenkins asks if churchill was moved more by foreboding than by regret but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. he adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than president trumans use of the second atomic bomb on nagasaki six months later. andrew marr, quoting max hastings, says that churchills memorandum was a calculated political attempt..... to distance himself..... from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive.

on  may  at the shaef headquarters in reims the allies accepted germanys surrender. the next day was victory in europe day  when churchill broadcast to the nation that germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire on all fronts in europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night . afterwards, churchill went to buckingham palace where he appeared on the balcony with the royal family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. he went from the palace to whitehall where he addressed another large crowd god bless you all. this is your victory. in our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this. everyone, man or woman, has done their best.at this point he asked ernest bevin to come forward and share the applause. bevin said no, winston, this is your day, and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of for hes a jolly good fellow. in the evening, churchill made another broadcast to the nation asserting that the defeat of japan would follow in the coming months .

in may , winston churchill commissioned the british chiefs of staff committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the ussr, codenamed operation unthinkable. one plan involved a surprise attack on soviet troops stationed in germany in order to impose the will of the united states and the british empire on the soviets. the hypothetical start date for the allied invasion of sovietheld europe was set for  july .

with a general election looming , and with the labour ministers refusing to continue the wartime coalition, churchill resigned as prime minister on  may . later that day, he accepted the kings invitation to form a new government, known officially as the national government, like the conservativedominated coalition of the s, but sometimes called the caretaker ministry. it contained conservatives, national liberals and a few nonparty figures such as sir john anderson and lord woolton, but not labour or archibald sinclairs official liberals. although churchill continued to carry out the functions of prime minister, including exchanging messages with the us administration about the upcoming potsdam conference, he was not formally reappointed until  may.

churchill was great britains representative at the postwar potsdam conference when it opened on  july and was accompanied at its sessions not only by eden as foreign secretary but also, pending the result of the july general election, by attlee. they attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to england for their election counts. after the landslide labour victory, attlee returned with bevin as the new foreign secretary and there were a further five days of discussion. potsdam went badly for churchill. eden later described his performance as appalling, saying that he was unprepared and verbose. churchill upset the chinese, exasperated the americans and was easily led by stalin, whom he was supposed to be resisting.

churchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate labour. on  june, he committed a serious political gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a labour government would require some form of gestapo to enforce its agenda. it backfired badly and attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day the voice we heard last night was that of mr churchill, but the mind was that of lord beaverbrook. jenkins says that this broadcast was the making of attlee.although polling day was  july, the results of the election did not become known until  july, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. clementine and daughter mary had been at the count in woodford, churchills new constituency in essex, and had returned to downing street to meet him for lunch. churchill was unopposed by the major parties in woodford, but his majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. he now anticipated defeat by labour and mary later described the lunch as an occasion of stygian gloom. to clementines suggestion that election defeat might be a blessing in disguise, churchill retorted at the moment it seems very effectively disguised.that afternoon churchills doctor lord moran  commiserated with him on the ingratitude of the british public, to which churchill replied i wouldnt call it that. they have had a very hard time. having lost the election, despite enjoying much personal support amongst the british population, he resigned as prime minister that evening and was succeeded by attlee who formed the first majority labour government. many reasons have been given for churchills defeat, key among them being that a desire for postwar reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace. although the conservative party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted churchill to continue as prime minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.

churchill continued to lead the conservative party and, for six years, served as leader of the opposition. in , he was in america for nearly three months from early january to late march. it was on this trip that he gave his iron curtain speech about the ussr and its creation of the eastern bloc. speaking on  march  in the company of president truman at westminster college in fulton, missouri, churchill declared

from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent. behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe. warsaw, berlin, prague, vienna, budapest, belgrade, bucharest and sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what i must call the soviet sphere.

the essence of his view was that, though the soviet union did not want war with the western allies, its entrenched position in eastern europe had made it impossible for the three great powers to provide the world with a triangular leadership. churchills desire was much closer collaboration between britain and america. within the same speech, he called for a special relationship between the british commonwealth and empire and the united states, but he emphasised the need for cooperation within the framework of the united nations charter.

churchill was an early proponent of paneuropeanism, having called for a united states of europe in a  article. he supported the creations of the council of europe in  and the european coal and steel community in , but his support was always with the firm proviso that britain must not actually join any federal grouping.having lived in ireland as a child, churchill always opposed its partition. as a minister in  and again in , he suggested that ulster should be part of a united ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent irish government. he was always opposed on this by ulster unionists. while he was leader of the opposition, he told john w. dulanty and frederick boland, successive irish ambassadors to london, that he still hoped for reunification.labour won the  general election, but with a muchreduced majority. churchill continued to serve as leader of the opposition.

despite losing the popular vote to labour, the conservatives won an overall majority of  seats in the october  general election and churchill again became prime minister, remaining in office until his resignation on  april . eden, his eventual successor, was restored to foreign affairs, the portfolio with which churchill was preoccupied throughout his tenure. future prime minister harold macmillan was appointed minister of housing and local government with a manifesto commitment to build , new houses per annum, churchills only real domestic concern. he achieved the target and, in october , was promoted to minister of defence.

churchill was nearly  when he took office and was not in good health following several minor strokes. by december , george vi had become concerned about churchills decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of eden, but the king had his own serious health issues and died on  february  without making the request. churchill developed a close friendship with elizabeth ii and, in the spring of , he accepted the order of the garter at her request. he was knighted as sir winston on  april . it was widely expected that he would retire after the queens coronation in june  but, after eden became seriously ill, churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the foreign office. eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and was never completely well again.on the evening of  june , churchill suffered a serious stroke and became partially paralysed down one side. had eden been well, churchills premiership would most likely have been over. the matter was kept secret and churchill went home to chartwell to recuperate. he had fully recovered by november. he retired as prime minister in april  and was succeeded by eden.

churchill feared a global conflagration and firmly believed that the only way to preserve peace and freedom was to build on a solid foundation of friendship and cooperation between britain and america. he made four official transatlantic visits from january  to july .he enjoyed a good relationship with truman but difficulties arose over the planned european defence community , by which truman hoped to reduce americas military presence in west germany; churchill was sceptical about the edc. churchill wanted us military support of british interests in egypt and the middle east, but that was refused. while truman expected british military involvement in korea, he viewed any us commitment to the middle east as maintaining british imperialism. the americans recognised that the british empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the attlee governments policy of decolonisation. churchill believed that britains position as a world power depended on the empires continued existence.churchill had been obliged to recognise colonel nassers revolutionary government of egypt, which took power in . much to churchills private dismay, agreement was reached in october  on the phased evacuation of british troops from their suez base. in addition, britain agreed to terminate its rule in angloegyptian sudan by , though this was in return for nassers abandonment of egyptian claims over the region. elsewhere, the malayan emergency, a guerrilla war fought by communist fighters against commonwealth forces, had begun in  and continued past malayan independence  until . churchills government maintained the military response to the crisis and adopted a similar strategy for the mau mau uprising in british kenya .churchill was uneasy about the election of eisenhower as trumans successor. after stalin died on  march , churchill sought a summit meeting with the soviets but eisenhower refused out of fear that the soviets would use it for propaganda. by july of that year, churchill was deeply regretting that the democrats had not been returned. he told colville that eisenhower as president was both weak and stupid. churchill believed that eisenhower did not fully comprehend the danger posed by the hbomb and he greatly distrusted eisenhowers secretary of state, john foster dulles. churchill hosted eisenhower to no avail at the threepowers bermuda conference  in december ; they met again in june/july  at the white house. in the end, it was the soviets who proposed a fourpower summit, but it did not meet until  july , three months after churchill had retired.

elizabeth ii offered to create churchill duke of london, but he declined because of the objections of his son randolph, who would have inherited the title on his fathers death. although publicly supportive, churchill was privately scathing about edens handling of the suez crisis and clementine believed that many of his visits to the united states in the following years were attempts to help repair angloamerican relations. after leaving the premiership, churchill remained an mp until he stood down at the  general election. apart from  to , he had been an mp since october  and had represented five constituencies.by the time of the  general election, he seldom attended the house of commons. despite the conservative landslide in , his own majority in woodford fell by more than . he spent most of his retirement at chartwell or at his london home in hyde park gate, and became a habitué of high society at la pausa on the french riviera.in june , when he was , churchill had a fall in monte carlo and broke his hip. he was flown home to a london hospital where he remained for three weeks. jenkins says that churchill was never the same after this accident and his last two years were something of a twilight period. in , us president john f. kennedy, acting under authorisation granted by an act of congress, proclaimed him an honorary citizen of the united states, but he was unable to attend the white house ceremony. there has been speculation that he became very depressed in his final years but this has been emphatically denied by his personal secretary anthony montague browne, who was with him for his last  years. montague browne wrote that he never heard churchill refer to depression and certainly he did not suffer from it.

churchill suffered his final stroke on  january  and died twelve days later on  january, the seventieth anniversary of his fathers death. like the duke of wellington in  and william gladstone in , churchill was given a state funeral. planning for this had begun in  under the codename of operation hope not and a detailed plan had been produced by . his coffin lay in state at westminster hall for three days and the funeral ceremony was at st pauls cathedral on  january. afterwards, the coffin was taken by boat along the river thames to waterloo station and from there by a special train to the family plot at st martins church, bladon, near his birthplace at blenheim palace.worldwide, numerous memorials have been dedicated to churchill. his statue in parliament square was unveiled by his widow clementine in  and is one of only twelve in the square, all of prominent political figures, including churchills friend lloyd george and his india policy nemesis gandhi. elsewhere in london, the wartime cabinet war rooms have been renamed the churchill museum and cabinet war rooms. churchill college, cambridge, was established as a national memorial to churchill.  an indication of churchills high esteem in the uk is the result of the  bbc poll, attracting , votes, in which he was voted the greatest briton of all time, his nearest rival being isambard kingdom brunel some , votes behind.he is one of only eight people to be granted honorary citizenship of the united states; others include lafayette, raoul wallenberg and mother teresa. the united states navy honoured him in  by naming a new arleigh burkeclass destroyer as the uss winston s. churchill. other memorials in north america include the national churchill museum in fulton, missouri, where he made the  iron curtain speech; churchill square in central edmonton, alberta; and the winston churchill range, a mountain range northwest of lake louise, also in alberta, which was renamed after churchill in .the churchill archives centre on the campus of churchill college, cambridge houses churchills personal papers and is open to the public.

churchill was a prolific writer. his output included a novel , two biographies, three volumes of memoirs, several histories, and numerous press articles. two of his most famous works, published after his first premiership brought his international fame to new heights, were his sixvolume memoir, the second world war, and the fourvolume a history of the englishspeaking peoples. in recognition of his mastery of historical and biographical description and oratorial output, churchill received the nobel prize in literature in .he used either winston s. churchill or winston spencer churchill as his pen name to avoid confusion with the american novelist of the same name, with whom he struck up a friendly correspondence. for many years, he relied heavily upon his press articles to assuage his financial worries in , for example, he wrote  published articles and some of his contracts were quite lucrative.as well as writing, churchill became an accomplished amateur artist after his resignation from the admiralty in . using the pseudonym charles morin, he continued this hobby throughout his life and completed hundreds of paintings, many of which are on show in the studio at chartwell as well as in private collections.churchill was an amateur bricklayer, constructing buildings and garden walls at chartwell. to further this hobby, he joined the amalgamated union of building trade workers but was expelled after he revived his membership of the conservative party. he also bred butterflies at chartwell, keeping them in a converted summerhouse each year until the weather was right for their release. he was well known for his love of animals and always had several pets, mainly cats but also dogs, pigs, lambs, bantams, goats and fox cubs among others. churchill has often been quoted as saying that cats look down on us and dogs look up to us, but pigs treat us as equals, or words to that effect, but the international churchill society believe he has mostly been misquoted.

roy jenkins concludes his biography of churchill by comparing him favourably with w. e. gladstone and summarising

i now put churchill, with all his idiosyncrasies, his indulgences, his occasional childishness, but also his genius, his tenacity and his persistent ability, right or wrong, successful or unsuccessful, to be larger than life, as the greatest human being ever to occupy  downing street.

churchill always selfconfidently believed himself to be a man of destiny. because of this he lacked restraint and could be reckless. his selfbelief manifested itself in terms of his affinity with war of which, according to sebastian haffner, he exhibited a profound and innate understanding. churchill considered himself a military genius but that made him vulnerable to failure and paul addison says gallipoli was the greatest blow his selfimage was ever to sustain. jenkins points out, however, that although churchill was excited and exhilarated by war, he was never indifferent to the suffering it causes.

as a politician, churchill was perceived by some observers to have been largely motivated by personal ambition rather than political principle. during his early parliamentary career, he was often deliberately provocative and argumentative to an unusual degree; and his barbed rhetorical style earned him many enemies in parliament. on the other hand, he was deemed to be an honest politician who displayed particular loyalty to his family and close friends. he was, according to jenkins, singularly lacking in inhibition or concealment. robert rhodes james said he lacked any capacity for intrigue and was refreshingly innocent and straightforward.until the outbreak of the second world war, churchills approach to politics generated widespread mistrust and dislike, largely on account of his two party defections. his biographers have variously categorised him, in terms of political ideology, as fundamentally conservative,  liberal in outlook, and never circumscribed by party affiliation. jenkins says that churchills selfbelief was far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty. whether churchill was a conservative or a liberal, he was nearly always opposed to socialism because of its propensity for state planning and his belief in free markets. the exception was during his wartime coalition when he was completely reliant upon the support of his labour colleagues. although the labour leaders were willing to join his coalition, churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class. his response to the rhondda valley unrest and his antisocialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists. they saw him as a reactionary who represented imperialism, militarism, and the interests of the upper classes in the class war. his role in opposing the general strike earned the enmity of many strikers and most members of the labour movement. paradoxically, churchill was supportive of trade unionism, which he saw as the antithesis of socialism.on the other hand, his detractors did not take churchills domestic reforms into account, for he was in many respects a radical and a reformer, but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure, never of challenging it. he could not empathise with the poor, so he sympathised with them instead, displaying what addison calls the attitude of a benevolent paternalist. jenkins, himself a senior labour minister, remarked that churchill had a substantial record as a social reformer for his work in the early years of his ministerial career. similarly, rhodes james thought that, as a social reformer, churchills achievements were considerable. this, said rhodes james, had been achieved because churchill as a minister had three outstanding qualities. he worked hard; he put his proposals efficiently through the cabinet and parliament; he carried his department with him. these ministerial merits are not as common as might be thought.

assessments of churchills legacy are largely based on his leadership of the british people in the second world war. even so, his personal views on empire and race continue to stir debate. churchill was a staunch imperialist and monarchist, and he consistently exhibited a romanticised view of both the british empire and the reigning monarch, especially of elizabeth ii during his last term as premier.churchill has been described as a liberal imperialist who saw british imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples because by conquering and dominating other peoples, the british were also elevating and protecting them. martin gilbert asserted that churchill held a hierarchical perspective of race, seeing racial characteristics as signs of the maturity of a society. churchills views on race were driven by his imperialist mindset and outlook. he advocated against black or indigenous selfrule in africa, australia, the caribbean, the americas and india, believing that the british empire promoted and maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies; he insisted that our responsibility to the native races remains a real one. in , churchill stated that we will endeavour ... to advance the principle of equal rights of civilised men irrespective of colour.according to addison, churchill was opposed to immigration from the commonwealth. addison makes the point that churchill opposed antisemitism  and argues that he would never have tried to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants, or to persecute minorities.  in the s, churchill supported zionism but believed that communism was the product of an international jewish conspiracy; in an article in the illustrated sunday herald, churchill wrote that a group of international jews supported a bolshevist worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality. although this belief was not unique among british politicians of the time, few had the stature of churchill, and the article was criticised by the jewish chronicle at the time.churchill made a number of disparaging remarks about nonwhite ethnicities throughout his life, including a series of racist comments and jokes about indian nationalists made to colleagues during the interwar period and his wartime premiership. historian philip murphy partly attributes the strength of this vitriol to an almost childish desire to shock his inner circle. churchills response to the bengal famine was criticised by some contemporaries as slow , a controversy later increased by the publication of private remarks made to secretary for india leo amery, in which churchill allegedly said that aid would be inadequate because indians were breeding like rabbits. philip murphy says that, following the independence of india in , churchill adopted a more pragmatic stance towards empire, although he continued to use imperial rhetoric. during his second term as prime minister, he was seen as a moderating influence on britains suppression of armed insurgencies against colonial rule in malaya and kenya; he argued that ruthless policies contradicted british values and international opinion.

while the biographies by addison, gilbert, jenkins and rhodes james are among the most acclaimed works about churchill, he has been the subject of numerous others. writing in  for the international churchill society, david freeman counted  in total, excluding nonenglish books, to the end of the th century.at a public ceremony in westminster hall on  november , churchills th birthday, the joint houses of parliament presented him with a fulllength portrait of himself, which had been painted by graham sutherland. churchill and clementine reportedly hated it and, later, she had it destroyed.churchill has been widely depicted on stage and screen. notable screen biographical films include young winston , directed by richard attenborough and featuring simon ward in the title role with anne bancroft and robert shaw as his parents; winston churchill the wilderness years , starring robert hardy as churchill and siân phillips as clementine; the gathering storm , starring albert finney as churchill and vanessa redgrave as clementine; into the storm , starring brendan gleeson as churchill and janet mcteer as clementine; darkest hour , starring gary oldman as churchill. john lithgow played churchill in the crown . finney, gleeson, oldman and lithgow all won major awards for their performances as churchill.

churchill married clementine hozier in september . they remained married for  years. churchill was aware of the strain that his political career placed on his marriage, and, according to colville, he had a brief affair in the s with doris castlerosse, although this is discounted by andrew roberts.the churchills first child, diana, was born in july ; the second, randolph, in may . their third, sarah, was born in october , and their fourth, marigold, in november . marigold died in august , from sepsis of the throat, and she was buried in kensal green cemetery.  although her remains were relocated to bladon churchyard in  to join the rest of her family, her cenotaph still stands at kensal green. on  september , the churchills last child, mary, was born. later that month, the churchills bought chartwell, which would be their home until winstons death in . according to jenkins, churchill was an enthusiastic and loving father but one who expected too much of his children.

russia , or the russian federation, is a country spanning eastern europe and northern asia. it is the largest country in the world by area, extends across eleven time zones, and shares land boundaries with fourteen countries. it is the worlds ninthmost populous country and europes most populous country. the countrys capital and largest city is moscow. saint petersburg is russias secondlargest city and cultural capital. other major urban areas in the country include novosibirsk, yekaterinburg, nizhny novgorod, chelyabinsk, krasnoyarsk, and kazan.

the east slavs emerged as a recognised group in europe between the rd and th centuries ce. the first east slavic state, kievan rus, arose in the th century, and in , it adopted orthodox christianity from the byzantine empire. rus ultimately disintegrated, with the grand duchy of moscow growing to become the tsardom of russia. by the early th century, russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of russian explorers, developing into the russian empire, which remains the thirdlargest empire in history. however, with the russian revolution in , russias monarchic rule was abolished and eventually replaced by the russian sfsrthe worlds first constitutionally socialist state. following the russian civil war, the russian sfsr established the soviet union with three other soviet republics, within which it was the largest and principal constituent. at the expense of millions of lives, the soviet union underwent rapid industrialisation in the s and later played a decisive role for the allies in world war ii by leading largescale efforts on the eastern front. with the onset of the cold war, it competed with the united states for global ideological influence. the soviet era of the th century saw some of the most significant russian technological achievements, including the first humanmade satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.

in , the russian sfsr emerged from the dissolution of the soviet union as the independent russian federation. a new constitution was adopted, which established a federal semipresidential system. since the turn of the century, russias political system has been dominated by vladimir putin, under whom the country has experienced democratic backsliding and a shift towards authoritarianism. russia has been militarily involved in a number of conflicts in neighbouring states, which have included the internationally unrecognised annexations of crimea in  from neighbouring ukraine, followed by the further annexation of four other regions in  during an ongoing invasion.

internationally, russia ranks among the lowest in measurements of democracy, human rights and freedom of the press; the country also has high levels of perceived corruption. the russian economy ranks th by nominal gdp, relying heavily on its abundant natural resources. its mineral and energy sources are the worlds largest, and its figures for oil production and natural gas production rank highly globally. the russian gdp ranks th by per capita; russia possesses the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons and has the thirdhighest military expenditure. the country is a permanent member of the united nations security council; a member state of the g, sco, brics, apec, osce, and wto; and the leading member state of postsoviet organisations such as cis, csto, and eaeu/eeu. russia is home to  unesco world heritage sites.

according to the primary chronicle, the word rus is derived  from the rus people, who were a swedish tribe, and where the three original members of the rurikid dynastry came from.  the finnish word for swedes, ruotsi, has the same origin. 

later archeological studies mostly confirmed this theory.the word russia is a medieval latin name for rus, a medieval state populated primarily by the east slavs. in modern historiography, this state is usually denoted as kievan rus after its capital city.  another medieval latin name for rus was ruthenia.in russian, the current name of the country, россия , comes from the byzantine greek name for rus, ρωσία . a new form of the name rus, росия , was borrowed from the greek term and first attested in , before coming into official use by the th century, though the country was still often referred to by its inhabitants as rus or the russian land until the end of the th century. there are two words in russian which translate to russians in english  русские , which refers to ethnic russians, and россияне , which refers to russian citizens, regardless of ethnicity.

the first human settlement on russia dates back to the oldowan period in the early lower paleolithic. about  million years ago, representatives of homo erectus migrated to the taman peninsula in southern russia. flint tools, some . million years old, have been discovered in the north caucasus. radiocarbon dated specimens from denisova cave in the altai mountains estimate the oldest denisovan specimen lived , years ago. fossils of denny, an archaic human hybrid that was half neanderthal and half denisovan, and lived some , years ago, was also found within the latter cave. russia was home to some of the last surviving neanderthals, from about , years ago, found in mezmaiskaya cave.the first trace of an early modern human in russia dates back to , years, in western siberia. the discovery of high concentration cultural remains of anatomically modern humans, from at least , years ago, was found at kostyonkiborshchyovo, and at sungir, dating back to , years agoboth in western russia. humans reached arctic russia at least , years ago, in mamontovaya kurya. ancient north eurasian populations from siberia genetically similar to maltaburet culture and afontova gora were an important genetic contributor to ancient native americans and eastern huntergatherers.

the kurgan hypothesis places the volgadnieper region of southern russia and ukraine as the urheimat of the protoindoeuropeans. early indoeuropean migrations from the ponticcaspian steppe of ukraine and russia spread yamnaya ancestry and indoeuropean languages across large parts of eurasia. nomadic pastoralism developed in the ponticcaspian steppe beginning in the chalcolithic. remnants of these steppe civilizations were discovered in places such as ipatovo, sintashta, arkaim, and pazyryk, which bear the earliest known traces of horses in warfare. the genetic makeup of speakers of the uralic language family in northern europe was shaped by migration from siberia that began at least , years ago.in the rd to th centuries ce, the gothic kingdom of oium existed in southern russia, which was later overrun by huns. between the rd and th centuries ce, the bosporan kingdom, which was a hellenistic polity that succeeded the greek colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the huns and eurasian avars. the khazars, who were of turkic origin, ruled the steppes between the caucasus in the south, to the east past the volga river basin, and west as far as kyiv on the dnieper river until the th century. after them came the pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the cumans and the kipchaks.the ancestors of russians are among the slavic tribes that separated from the protoindoeuropeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of europe c.years ago. the east slavs gradually settled western russia  in two waves one moving from kiev towards presentday suzdal and murom and another from polotsk towards novgorod and rostov. prior to slavic migration, that territory was populated by finnishspeaking people. from the th century onwards, the incoming east slavs slowly but peacefully assimilated the native finnic peoples.

the establishment of the first east slavic states in the th century coincided with the arrival of varangians, the vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern baltic to the black and caspian seas. according to the primary chronicle, a varangian from the rus people, named rurik, was elected ruler of novgorod in . in , his successor oleg ventured south and conquered kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the khazars. ruriks son igor and igors son sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local east slavic tribes to kievan rule, destroyed the khazar khaganate, and launched several military expeditions to byzantium and persia.in the th to th centuries, kievan rus became one of the largest and most prosperous states in europe. the reigns of vladimir the great  and his son yaroslav the wise  constitute the golden age of kiev, which saw the acceptance of orthodox christianity from byzantium, and the creation of the first east slavic written legal code, the russkaya pravda. the age of feudalism and decentralisation had come, marked by constant infighting between members of the rurik dynasty that ruled kievan rus collectively. kievs dominance waned, to the benefit of vladimirsuzdal in the northeast, the novgorod republic in the north, and galiciavolhynia in the southwest. by the th century, kiev lost its preeminence and kievan rus had fragmented into different principalities. prince andrey bogolyubsky sacked kiev in  and made vladimir his base, leading to political power being shifted to the northeast.led by prince alexander nevsky, novgorodians repelled the invading swedes in the battle of the neva in , as well as the germanic crusaders in the battle on the ice in .kievan rus finally fell to the mongol invasion of , which resulted in the sacking of kiev and other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population. the invaders, later known as tatars, formed the state of the golden horde, which ruled over russia for the next two centuries. only the novgorod republic escaped foreign occupation after it surrendered and agreed to pay tribute to the mongols. galiciavolhynia would later be absorbed by lithuania and poland, while the novgorod republic continued to prosper in the north. in the northeast, the byzantineslavic traditions of kievan rus were adapted to form the russian autocratic state.

the destruction of kievan rus saw the eventual rise of the grand duchy of moscow, initially a part of vladimirsuzdal. while still under the domain of the mongoltatars and with their connivance, moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the gathering of the russian lands. when the seat of the metropolitan of the russian orthodox church moved to moscow in , its influence increased. moscows last rival, the novgorod republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the hanseatic league.led by prince dmitry donskoy of moscow, the united army of russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the mongoltatars in the battle of kulikovo in . moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as tver and novgorod.ivan iii  threw off the control of the golden horde and consolidated the whole of northern rus under moscows dominion, and was the first russian ruler to take the title grand duke of all rus. after the fall of constantinople in , moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the eastern roman empire. ivan iii married sophia palaiologina, the niece of the last byzantine emperor constantine xi, and made the byzantine doubleheaded eagle his own, and eventually russias, coatofarms. vasili iii united all of russia by annexing the last few independent russian states in the early th century.

in development of the third rome ideas, the grand duke ivan iv  was officially crowned the first tsar of russia in . the tsar promulgated a new code of laws , established the first russian feudal representative body , revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government. during his long reign, ivan nearly doubled the already large russian territory by annexing the three tatar khanates kazan and astrakhan along the volga, and the khanate of sibir in southwestern siberia. ultimately, by the end of the th century, russia expanded east of the ural mountains. however, the tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful livonian war against the coalition of the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania , the kingdom of sweden, and denmarknorway for access to the baltic coast and sea trade. in , an invading army of crimean tatars were thoroughly defeated in the crucial battle of molodi.the death of ivans sons marked the end of the ancient rurik dynasty in , and in combination with the disastrous famine of , led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the time of troubles in the early th century. the polishlithuanian commonwealth, taking advantage, occupied parts of russia, extending into the capital moscow. in , the poles were forced to retreat by the russian volunteer corps, led by merchant kuzma minin and prince dmitry pozharsky. the romanov dynasty acceded to the throne in  by the decision of the zemsky sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.russia continued its territorial growth through the th century, which was the age of the cossacks. in , the ukrainian leader, bohdan khmelnytsky, offered to place ukraine under the protection of the russian tsar, alexis; whose acceptance of this offer led to another russopolish war. ultimately, ukraine was split along the dnieper, leaving the eastern part,  under russian rule. in the east, the rapid russian exploration and colonisation of vast siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory. russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the siberian river routes, and by the midth century, there were russian settlements in eastern siberia, on the chukchi peninsula, along the amur river, and on the coast of the pacific ocean. in , semyon dezhnyov became the first european to navigate through the bering strait.

under peter the great, russia was proclaimed an empire in , and established itself as one of the european great powers. ruling from  to , peter defeated sweden in the great northern war , securing russias access to the sea and sea trade. in , on the baltic sea, peter founded saint petersburg as russias new capital. throughout his rule, sweeping reforms were made, which brought significant western european cultural influences to russia. the reign of peter is daughter elizabeth in  saw russias participation in the seven years war . during the conflict, russian troops overran east prussia, reaching berlin. however, upon elizabeths death, all these conquests were returned to the kingdom of prussia by proprussian peter iii of russia.catherine ii , who ruled in , presided over the russian age of enlightenment. she extended russian political control over the polishlithuanian commonwealth and annexed most of its territories into russia, making it the most populous country in europe. in the south, after the successful russoturkish wars against the ottoman empire, catherine advanced russias boundary to the black sea, by dissolving the crimean khanate, and annexing crimea. as a result of victories over qajar iran through the russopersian wars, by the first half of the th century, russia also conquered the caucasus. catherines successor, her son paul, was unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues. following his short reign, catherines strategy was continued with alexander is  wresting of finland from the weakened sweden in , and of bessarabia from the ottomans in . in north america, the russians became the first europeans to reach and colonise alaska. in , the first russian circumnavigation was made. in , a russian expedition discovered the continent of antarctica.

during the napoleonic wars, russia joined alliances with various european powers, and fought against france. the french invasion of russia at the height of napoleons power in  reached moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the paneuropean grande armée faced utter destruction. led by mikhail kutuzov and michael andreas barclay de tolly, the imperial russian army ousted napoleon and drove throughout europe in the war of the sixth coalition, ultimately entering paris. alexander i controlled russias delegation at the congress of vienna, which defined the map of postnapoleonic europe.

the officers who pursued napoleon into western europe brought ideas of liberalism back to russia, and attempted to curtail the tsars powers during the abortive decembrist revolt of . at the end of the conservative reign of nicholas i , a zenith period of russias power and influence in europe, was disrupted by defeat in the crimean war.

nicholass successor alexander ii  enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the emancipation reform of . these reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the imperial russian army, which liberated much of the balkans from ottoman rule in the aftermath of the  russoturkish war. during most of the th and early th century, russia and britain colluded over afghanistan and its neighbouring territories in central and south asia; the rivalry between the two major european empires came to be known as the great game.the late th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in russia. alexander ii was assassinated in  by revolutionary terrorists. the reign of his son alexander iii  was less liberal but more peaceful.

under last russian emperor, nicholas ii , the revolution of  was triggered by the failure of the humiliating russojapanese war.  the uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms , including granting freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the state duma.

in , russia entered world war i in response to austriahungarys declaration of war on russias ally serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its triple entente allies. in , the brusilov offensive of the imperial russian army almost completely destroyed the austrohungarian army. however, the alreadyexisting public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason. all this formed the climate for the russian revolution of , carried out in two major acts. in early , nicholas ii was forced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the russian civil war. the monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the provisional government, and proclaimed the russian republic. on  january o.s.  january, , the russian constituent assembly declared russia a democratic federal republic . the next day the constituent assembly was dissolved by the allrussian central executive committee.an alternative socialist establishment coexisted, the petrograd soviet, wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called soviets. the rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the october revolution, led by bolshevik leader vladimir lenin, overthrew the provisional government and gave full governing power to the soviets, leading to the creation of the worlds first socialist state. the russian civil war broke out between the anticommunist white movement and the bolsheviks with its red army. in the aftermath of signing the treaty of brestlitovsk that concluded hostilities with the central powers of world war i; bolshevist russia surrendered most of its western territories, which hosted  of its population,  of its industries,  of its agricultural land, and roughly  of its coal mines.

the allied powers launched an unsuccessful military intervention in support of anticommunist forces. in the meantime, both the bolsheviks and white movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the red terror and white terror. by the end of the violent civil war, russias economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as  million perished during the war, mostly civilians. millions became white émigrés, and the russian famine of  claimed up to five million victims.

on  december , lenin and his aides formed the soviet union, by joining the russian sfsr into a single state with the byelorussian, transcaucasian, and ukrainian republics. eventually internal border changes and annexations during world war ii created a union of  republics; the largest in size and population being the russian sfsr, which dominated the union for its entire history politically, culturally, and economically.following lenins death in , a troika was designated to take charge. eventually joseph stalin, the general secretary of the communist party, managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the countrys dictator by the s. leon trotsky, the main proponent of world revolution, was exiled from the soviet union in , and stalins idea of socialism in one country became the official line. the continued internal struggle in the bolshevik party culminated in the great purge.

under stalins leadership, the government launched a command economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivisation of its agriculture. during this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labour camps, including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to stalins rule; and millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the soviet union. the transitional disorganisation of the countrys agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the soviet famine of ; which killed up to . million, . million of them in the russian sfsr. the soviet union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.

the soviet union entered world war ii on  september  with its invasion of poland, in accordance with a secret protocol within the molotovribbentrop pact with nazi germany. the soviet union later invaded finland, and occupied and annexed the baltic states, as well as parts of romania. on  june , germany invaded the soviet union, opening the eastern front, the largest theater of world war ii.eventually, some  million red army troops were captured by the nazis; the latter deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed . million soviet pows, and a vast number of civilians, as the hunger plan sought to fulfil generalplan ost. although the wehrmacht had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the battle of moscow. subsequently, the germans were dealt major defeats first at the battle of stalingrad in the winter of , and then in the battle of kursk in the summer of . another german failure was the siege of leningrad, in which the city was fully blockaded on land between  and  by german and finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. soviet forces steamrolled through eastern and central europe in  and captured berlin in may . in august , the red army invaded manchuria and ousted the japanese from northeast asia, contributing to the allied victory over japan.the  period of world war ii is known in russia as the great patriotic war. the soviet union, along with the united states, the united kingdom and china were considered the big four of allied powers in world war ii, and later became the four policemen, which was the foundation of the united nations security council. during the war, soviet civilian and military death were about  million, accounting for about half of all world war ii casualties. the soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused the soviet famine of . however, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the soviet union emerged as a global superpower.

after world war ii, parts of eastern and central europe, including east germany and eastern parts of austria were occupied by red army according to the potsdam conference.  dependent communist governments were installed in the eastern bloc satellite states. after becoming the worlds second nuclear power, the soviet union established the warsaw pact alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the cold war, with the rivalling united states and nato.

after stalins death in  and a short period of collective rule, the new leader nikita khrushchev denounced stalin and launched the policy of destalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the gulag labour camps. the general easement of repressive policies became known later as the khrushchev thaw. at the same time, cold war tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the united states jupiter missiles in turkey and soviet missiles in cuba.in , the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite, sputnik , thus starting the space age. russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first human to orbit the earth, aboard the vostok  crewed spacecraft on  april .

following the ousting of khrushchev in , another period of collective rule ensued, until leonid brezhnev became the leader. the era of the s and the early s was later designated as the era of stagnation. the  kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the soviet economy. in , after a communistled revolution in afghanistan, soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the sovietafghan war. in may , the soviets started to withdraw from afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent antisoviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by soviet citizens.

from  onwards, the last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost  and perestroika  in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. this, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. prior to , the soviet economy was the worlds secondlargest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.by , economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the baltic states chose to secede from the soviet union. on  march, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the soviet union into a renewed federation. in june , boris yeltsin became the first directly elected president in russian history when he was elected president of the russian sfsr. in august , a coup détat attempt by members of gorbachevs government, directed against gorbachev and aimed at preserving the soviet union, instead led to the end of the communist party of the soviet union. on  december , following the dissolution of the soviet union, along with contemporary russia, fourteen other postsoviet states emerged.

the economic and political collapse of the soviet union led russia into a deep and prolonged depression. during and after the disintegration of the soviet union, wideranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of shock therapy. the privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of the infamous russian oligarchs. many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight. the depression of the economy led to the collapse of social servicesthe birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, and millions plunged into poverty; while extreme corruption, as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.in late , tensions between yeltsin and the russian parliament culminated in a constitutional crisis which ended violently through military force. during the crisis, yeltsin was backed by western governments, and over  people were killed.

in december, a referendum was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers. the s were plagued by armed conflicts in the north caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist islamist insurrections. from the time chechen separatists declared independence in the early s, an intermittent guerrilla war was fought between the rebel groups and russian forces. terrorist attacks against civilians were carried out by chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of russian civilians.after the dissolution of the soviet union, russia assumed responsibility for settling the latters external debts. in , most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the rouble. high budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the  russian financial crisis, which resulted in a further gdp decline.

on  december , president yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, vladimir putin. putin then won the  presidential election, and defeated the chechen insurgency in the second chechen war.putin won a second presidential term in . high oil prices and a rise in foreign investment saw the russian economy and living standards improve significantly. putins rule increased stability, while transforming russia into an authoritarian state. in , putin took the post of prime minister, while dmitry medvedev was elected president for one term, to hold onto power despite legal term limits; this period has been described as a tandemocracy.

following a diplomatic crisis with neighbouring georgia, the russogeorgian war took place during  august , resulting in russia recognising two separatist states in the territories that it occupies in georgia. it was the first european war of the st century.

in early , following a revolution in ukraine, russia occupied and annexed crimea from neighbouring ukraine following a disputed referendum, with russian troops later participating in a war in eastern ukraine between russianbacked separatists and ukrainian troops. in a major escalation of the conflict, russia launched a fullscale invasion of ukraine on  february . the invasion marked the largest conventional war in europe since world war ii, and was met with international condemnation, as well as expanded sanctions against russia. as a result, russia was expelled from the council of europe in march, and was suspended from the united nations human rights council in april. in september, following successful ukrainian counteroffensives, putin announced a partial mobilisation, russias first mobilisation since world war ii. by the end of september, putin proclaimed the annexation of four ukrainian regions, the largest annexation in europe since world war ii. putin and russianinstalled leaders signed treaties of accession, internationally unrecognized and widely denounced as illegal, despite the fact that russian forces have been unable to fully occupy any of the four regions. a number of supranational and national parliaments passed resolutions declaring russia to be a state sponsor of terrorism. in addition, russia was declared a terrorist state by latvia, lithuania and estonia. hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been killed as a result of the invasion. the war in ukraine has further exacerbated russias demographic crisis.in june , the wagner group, a private military contractor fighting for russia in ukraine, declared an open rebellion against the russian ministry of defense, capturing rostovondon, before beginning a march on moscow. however, after negotiations between wagner and the belarusian government, the rebellion was called off.

russias vast landmass stretches over the easternmost part of europe and the northernmost part of asia. it spans the northernmost edge of eurasia; and has the worlds fourthlongest coastline, of over , km . russia lies between latitudes  and  n, and longitudes  e and  w, extending some , km  east to west, and , to , km  north to south. russia, by landmass, is larger than three continents, and has the same surface area as pluto.russia has nine major mountain ranges, and they are found along the southernmost regions, which share a significant portion of the caucasus mountains ; the altai and sayan mountains in siberia; and in the east siberian mountains and the kamchatka peninsula in the russian far east . the ural mountains, running north to south through the countrys west, are rich in mineral resources, and form the traditional boundary between europe and asia. the lowest point in russia and europe, is situated at the head of the caspian sea, where the caspian depression reaches some  metres  below sea level.russia, as one of the worlds only three countries bordering three oceans, has links with a great number of seas. its major islands and archipelagos include novaya zemlya, franz josef land, severnaya zemlya, the new siberian islands, wrangel island, the kuril islands , and sakhalin. the diomede islands, administered by russia and the united states, are just . km  apart; and kunashir island of the kuril islands is merely  km  from hokkaido, japan.russia, home of over , rivers, has one of the worlds largest surface water resources, with its lakes containing approximately onequarter of the worlds liquid fresh water. lake baikal, the largest and most prominent among russias fresh water bodies, is the worlds deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake, containing over onefifth of the worlds fresh surface water. ladoga and onega in northwestern russia are two of the largest lakes in europe. russia is second only to brazil by total renewable water resources. the volga in western russia, widely regarded as russias national river, is the longest river in europe; and forms the volga delta, the largest river delta in the continent. the siberian rivers of ob, yenisey, lena, and amur are among the worlds longest rivers.

the size of russia and the remoteness of many of its areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate throughout most of the country, except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. mountain ranges in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the indian and pacific oceans, while the european plain spanning its west and north opens it to influence from the atlantic and arctic oceans. most of northwest russia and siberia have a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of northeast siberia , and more moderate winters elsewhere. russias vast coastline along the arctic ocean and the russian arctic islands have a polar climate.the coastal part of krasnodar krai on the black sea, most notably sochi, and some coastal and interior strips of the north caucasus possess a humid subtropical climate with mild and wet winters.  in many regions of east siberia and the russian far east, winter is dry compared to summer; while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. the westernmost parts of kaliningrad oblast and some parts in the south of krasnodar krai and the north caucasus have an oceanic climate. the region along the lower volga and caspian sea coast, as well as some southernmost slivers of siberia, possess a semiarid climate.throughout much of the territory, there are only two distinct seasons, winter and summer; as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures. the coldest month is january ; the warmest is usually july. great ranges of temperature are typical. in winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. summers can be quite hot, even in siberia. climate change in russia is causing more frequent wildfires, and thawing the countrys large expanse of permafrost.

russia, owing to its gigantic size, has diverse ecosystems, including polar deserts, tundra, forest tundra, taiga, mixed and broadleaf forest, forest steppe, steppe, semidesert, and subtropics. about half of russias territory is forested, and it has the worlds largest area of forest, which sequester some of the worlds highest amounts of carbon dioxide.russian biodiversity includes , species of vascular plants, , species of bryophytes, about , species of lichens, ,, species of algae, and ,, species of fungi. russian fauna is composed of  species of mammals, over  species of birds,  species of reptiles, about  species of amphibians,  species of freshwater fish , approximately , species of saltwater fishes,  species of cyclostomata, and approximately , invertebrates . approximately , rare and endangered plant and animal species are included in the russian red data book.russias entirely natural ecosystems are conserved in nearly , specially protected natural territories of various statuses, occupying more than  of the countrys total area. they include  biosphere reserves,  national parks, and  nature reserves. although in decline, the country still has many ecosystems which are still considered intact forest; mainly in the northern taiga areas, and the subarctic tundra of siberia. russia had a forest landscape integrity index mean score of . in , ranking th out of  countries; and the first ranked major nation globally.

russia, by  constitution, is a symmetric federal republic with a semipresidential system, wherein the president is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of government. it is structured as a multiparty representative democracy, with the federal government composed of three branches

legislative the bicameral federal assembly of russia, made up of the member state duma and the member federation council, adopts federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse and the power of impeachment of the president.

executive the president is the commanderinchief of the armed forces, and appoints the government of russia  and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. the president may issue decrees of unlimited scope, so long as they do not contradict the constitution or federal law.

judiciary the constitutional court, supreme court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the federation council on the recommendation of the president, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem unconstitutional.the president is elected by popular vote for a sixyear term and may be elected no more than twice. ministries of the government are composed of the premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister . united russia is the dominant political party in russia, and has been described as big tent and the party of power. under the administrations of vladimir putin, russia has experienced democratic backsliding, and has become an authoritarian state under a dictatorship, with putins policies being referred to as putinism.

russia, by  constitution, is a symmetric  federation. unlike the soviet asymmetric model of the rsfsr, where only republics were subjects of the federation, the current constitution raised the status of other regions to the level of republics and made all regions equal with the title subject of the federation. the regions of russia have reserved areas of competence, but no regions have sovereignty, do not have the status of a sovereign state, do not have the right to indicate any sovereignty in their constitutions and do not have the right to secede from the country. the laws of the regions cannot contradict federal laws.the federal subjects have equal representationtwo delegates eachin the federation council, the upper house of the federal assembly. they do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy. the federal districts of russia were established by putin in  to facilitate central government control of the federal subjects. originally seven, currently there are eight federal districts, each headed by an envoy appointed by the president.

russia had the worlds fifthlargest diplomatic network in . it maintains diplomatic relations with  united nations member states, four partiallyrecognised states, and three united nations observer states; along with  embassies. russia is one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council. it has historically been a great power, and a former superpower as the leading constituent of the former soviet union. russia is a member of the g, the osce, and the apec. russia also takes a leading role in organisations such as the cis, the eaeu, the csto, the sco, and brics.russia maintains close relations with neighbouring belarus, which is a part of the union state, a supranational confederation of the two states. serbia has been a historically close ally of russia, as both countries share a strong mutual cultural, ethnic, and religious affinity. india is the largest customer of russian military equipment, and the two countries share a strong strategic and diplomatic relationship since the soviet era. russia wields influence across the geopolitically important south caucasus and central asia; and the two regions have been described as russias backyard.

in the st century russia has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at securing regional dominance and international influence, as well as increasing domestic support for the government. military intervention in the postsoviet states include a war with georgia in , and the invasion and destabilisation of ukraine beginning in . russia has also sought to increase its influence in the middle east, most significantly through military intervention in the syrian civil war. cyberwarfare and airspace violations, along with electoral interference, have been used to increase perceptions of russian power. russias relations with neighbouring ukraine and the western worldespecially the united states, the european union, the united nations and natohave collapsed; especially following the start of the russoukrainian war in  and the consequent escalation in . relations between russia and china have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economically; due to shared political interests. turkey and russia share a complex strategic, energy, and defence relationship. russia maintains cordial relations with iran, as it is a strategic and economic ally. russia has also increasingly pushed to expand its influence across the arctic, asiapacific, africa, the middle east, and latin america. according to the economist intelligence unit, twothirds of the worlds population live in countries such as china or india that are neutral or leaning towards russia.

the russian armed forces are divided into the ground forces, the navy, and the aerospace forcesand there are also two independent arms of service the strategic missile troops and the airborne troops. as of , the military have around a million activeduty personnel, which is the worlds fifthlargest, and about  million reserve personnel. it is mandatory for all male citizens aged  to be drafted for a year of service in the armed forces.russia is among the five recognised nuclearweapons states, with the worlds largest stockpile of nuclear weapons; over half of the worlds nuclear weapons are owned by russia. russia possesses the secondlargest fleet of ballistic missile submarines, and is one of the only three countries operating strategic bombers. russia maintains the worlds thirdhighest military expenditure, spending . billion in , corresponding to around . of its gdp. in  it was the worlds secondlargest arms exporter, and had a large and entirely indigenous defence industry, producing most of its own military equipment.

violations of human rights in russia have been increasingly criticised by leading democracy and human rights groups. in particular, amnesty international and human rights watch say that russia is not democratic and allows few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.since , freedom house has ranked russia as not free in its freedom in the world survey. since , the economist intelligence unit has ranked russia as an authoritarian regime in its democracy index, ranking it th out of  countries in . in regards to media freedom, russia was ranked th out of  countries in reporters without borders press freedom index for . the russian government has been widely criticised by political dissidents and human rights activists for unfair elections, crackdowns on opposition political parties and protests, persecution of nongovernmental organisations and enforced suppression and killings of independent journalists, and censorship of mass media and internet.muslims, especially salafis, have faced persecution in russia. to quash the insurgency in the north caucasus, russian authorities have been accused of indiscriminate killings, arrests, forced disappearances, and torture of civilians. in dagestan, some salafis along with facing government harassment based on their appearance, have had their homes blown up in counterinsurgency operations. chechens and ingush in russian prisons reportedly take more abuse than other ethnic groups. during the  invasion of ukraine, russia has set up filtration camps where many ukrainians are subjected to abuses and forcibly sent to russia; the camps have been compared to those used in the chechen wars.russia has introduced several restrictions on lgbt rights, including a  ban on samesex marriage and the designation of lgbt organisations such as the russian lgbt network as foreign agents.

russias autocratic political system has been variously described as a kleptocracy, an oligarchy, and a plutocracy. it was the lowest rated european country in transparency internationals corruption perceptions index for , ranking th out of  countries. russia has a long history of corruption, which is seen as a significant problem. it impacts various sectors, including the economy, business, public administration, law enforcement, healthcare, education, and the military.

the primary and fundamental statement of laws in russia is the constitution of the russian federation. statutes, like the russian civil code and the russian criminal code, are the predominant legal sources of russian law.russia has the worlds second largest illegal arms trade market, after the united states, is ranked first in europe and nd globally in the global organized crime index, and is among the countries with the highest number of people in prison.

russia has a market economy, with enormous natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. it has the worlds ninthlargest economy by nominal gdp and the sixthlargest by ppp. the large service sector accounts for  of total gdp, followed by the industrial sector , while the agricultural sector is the smallest, making up only  of total gdp. russia has a low official unemployment rate of .. its foreign exchange reserves are the worlds fifthlargest, worth  billion. it has a labour force of roughly  million, which is the worlds sixthlargest.russia is the worlds thirteenthlargest exporter and the stlargest importer. it relies heavily on revenues from oil and gasrelated taxes and export tariffs, which accounted for  of russias federal budget revenues in january , and up to  of its exports in . russia has one of the lowest levels of external debt among major economies, although its inequality of household income and wealth is one of the highest among developed countries. high regional disparity is also an issue.after over a decade of postsoviet rapid economic growth, backed by high oilprices and a surge in foreign exchange reserves and investment, russias economy was damaged following the start of the russoukrainian war and the annexation of crimea in , due to the first wave of western sanctions being imposed. in the aftermath of the russian invasion of ukraine in , the country has faced revamped sanctions and corporate boycotts, becoming the most sanctioned country in the world, in a move described as an allout economic and financial war to isolate the russian economy from the western financial system. due to the impact, the russian government has stopped publishing a raft of economic data since april . economists suggest the sanctions will have a longterm effect over the russian economy.

railway transport in russia is mostly under the control of the staterun russian railways. the total length of commonused railway tracks is the worlds thirdlongest, and exceeds , km . as of , russia has the worlds fifthlargest road network, with . million km of roads, while its road density is among the worlds lowest. russias inland waterways are the worlds longest, and total , km . among russias , airports, the busiest is sheremetyevo international airport in moscow. russias largest port is the port of novorossiysk in krasnodar krai along the black sea.russia was widely described as an energy superpower. it has the worlds largest proven gas reserves, the secondlargest coal reserves, the eighthlargest oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in europe. russia is also the worlds leading natural gas exporter, the secondlargest natural gas producer, and the secondlargest oil producer and exporter. russias oil and gas production led to deep economic relationships with the european union, china, and former soviet and eastern bloc states. for example, over the last decade, russias share of supplies to total european union  gas demand increased from  in  to  in the weeks before the russian invasion of ukraine in february .in the mids, the share of the oil and gas sector in gdp was around , and in  it was  of gdp. the share of oil and gas in russias exports  and federal budget revenues  is large, and the dynamics of russias gdp are highly dependent on oil and gas prices, but the share in gdp is much less than . according to the first such comprehensive assessment published by the russian statistics agency rosstat in , the maximum total share of the oil and gas sector in russias gdp, including extraction, refining, transport, sale of oil and gas, all goods and services used, and all supporting activities, amounts to . in  and . in . this is comparable to the share of gdp in norway and kazakhstan. it is much lower than the share of gdp in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates.russia ratified the paris agreement in . greenhouse gas emissions by russia are the worlds fourthlargest. russia is the worlds fourthlargest electricity producer. it was also the worlds first country to develop civilian nuclear power, and to construct the worlds first nuclear power plant. russia was also the worlds fourthlargest nuclear energy producer in , and was the fifthlargest hydroelectric producer in .

russias agriculture sector contributes about  of the countrys total gdp, although the sector employs about oneeighth of the total labour force. it has the worlds thirdlargest cultivated area, at ,, square kilometres . however, due to the harshness of its environment, about . of its land is agricultural, and only . of its land is arable. the countrys agricultural land is considered part of the breadbasket of europe. more than onethird of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the remaining farmland is devoted to industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits. the main product of russian farming has always been grain, which occupies considerably more than half of the cropland. russia is the worlds largest exporter of wheat, the largest producer of barley and buckwheat, among the largest exporters of maize and sunflower oil, and the leading producer of fertilizer.various analysts of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for russian agriculture during the rest of the st century as arability increases in siberia, which would lead to both internal and external migration to the region. owing to its large coastline along three oceans and twelve marginal seas, russia maintains the worlds sixthlargest fishing industry; capturing nearly  million tons of fish in . it is home to the worlds finest caviar, the beluga; and produces about onethird of all canned fish, and some onefourth of the worlds total fresh and frozen fish.

russia spent about  of its gdp on research and development in , with the worlds tenthhighest budget. it also ranked tenth worldwide in the number of scientific publications in , with roughly . million papers. since , nobel prize were awarded to  soviets and russians in physics, chemistry, medicine, economy, literature and peace. russia ranked st in the global innovation index in , down from th in .since the times of nikolay lobachevsky, who pioneered the noneuclidean geometry, and pafnuty chebyshev, a prominent tutor; russian mathematicians became among the worlds most influential. dmitry mendeleev invented the periodic table, the main framework of modern chemistry. nine soviet and russian mathematicians have been awarded with the fields medal. grigori perelman was offered the first ever clay millennium prize problems award for his final proof of the poincaré conjecture in , as well as the fields medal in .alexander popov was among the inventors of radio, while nikolai basov and alexander prokhorov were coinventors of laser and maser. oleg losev made crucial contributions in the field of semiconductor junctions, and discovered lightemitting diodes. vladimir vernadsky is considered one of the founders of geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and radiogeology. élie metchnikoff is known for his groundbreaking research in immunology. ivan pavlov is known chiefly for his work in classical conditioning. lev landau made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics.nikolai vavilov was best known for having identified the centres of origin of cultivated plants. trofim lysenko was known mainly for lysenkoism. many famous russian scientists and inventors were émigrés. igor sikorsky was an aviation pioneer. vladimir zworykin was the inventor of the iconoscope and kinescope television systems. theodosius dobzhansky was the central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work in shaping the modern synthesis. george gamow was one of the foremost advocates of the big bang theory.

due to the covid pandemic, a number of nonpharmaceutical interventions colloquially known as lockdowns  have been implemented in numerous countries and territories around the world. these restrictions were established with the intention to reduce the spread of sarscov, the virus that causes covid. by april , about half of the worlds population was under some form of lockdown, with more than . billion people in more than  countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments. although similar disease control measures have been used for hundreds of years, the scale of those implemented in the s is thought to be unprecedented.research and case studies have shown that lockdowns were generally effective at reducing the spread of covid, therefore flattening the curve. the world health organizations recommendation on lockdowns is that they should be very brief, shortterm measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted. to achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the who recommends a response to the pandemic that consists of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.in addition to the health effects of  lockdown restrictions, researchers have found the lockdowns have reduced crime and violence by armed nonstate actors, such as the islamic state, and other terrorist groups.  they have also had profound negative economic impacts, and have been met with protests in some territories.

several researchers, from modeling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns were somewhat effective at reducing the spread of, and deaths caused by, covid. lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing covid community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted too early.a study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in france, italy and the uk showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the start of confinement on the countries  with the strongest lockdowns. modelling on the united states pandemic suggested the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier and that the second wave would have been less severe had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.the stringent lockdown in hubei in early  proved effective at controlling the covid outbreak in china. the relatively high number of cases and deaths in sweden, which has kept much of its society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbours with comparable demographics norway, denmark and finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to be at least partly attributable to this difference in policy. similarly, modelling on australian data concluded that achieving zero community transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater costs. this zero community transmission approach was adopted in australia, and a strict four month lockdown in the state of victoria during an outbreak in melbourne, combined with other measures, averted a wider outbreak in the country in . new zealand and vietnam also adopted a zerocovid strategy throughout  that included targeted lockdowns.the emergence of the highly transmissible sarscov delta variant in  has led some commentators to suggest that although lockdowns continue to reduce the spread of covid, they have become less effective at containing it. lockdowns in australia and vietnam in response to delta outbreaks proved less effective at containment than previous lockdowns were against the spread of other variants.

one study led by an economist at the university of chicago found that involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing making up nearly  of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared the virus itself. similarly, a national bureau of economic research study found stayathome orders increased staying at home by just . another study from yale university found that most social distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by media coverage of morbidity and mortality.on the other hand, some studies have argued that coercive measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the reduction may have been voluntary. one of those two studies, by flaxman et al., has been criticized, among other things for having a countryspecific adjustment factor, without which the model would predict a massive number of deaths for sweden. one widely cited economic simulation asserting that shelterinplace orders reduced total cases threefold, however, held voluntary distancing constant. another study found a  difference among bordercounties where stayathome orders were imposed.another study that compared the impact of less restrictive interventions on the spread of covid in sweden and south korea, with mandatory stayat home orders in  other countries, such as france and spain, did not find evidence for greater disease control in the countries with more restrictions. however, the findings of the study have been questioned due to its numerous limitations, including the small sample size of countries.some research has also found that an advisory approach is not adequate to control covid outbreaks. an analysis of an outbreak in northern italy found that an effective reduction in community transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a level low enough to reduce the spread of covid.since the beginning of the pandemic, google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed. an april  poll found that  of americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.

a february  review of  articles concluded there was acknowledgement of the importance of nonpharmaceutical interventions in controlling the spread of covid. however, later research also acknowledges high societal costs, though in some circumstances less than the costs of allowing the pandemic to spread without mitigation.

epidemiological evidence supports generalized nonpharmaceutical interventions to curb the spread of covid.during the early stages of the pandemic in europe and the united states, statistical modeling which advised that restrictions were helpful to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for lockdowns. this includes an imperial college projection, led by epidemiologist neil ferguson. despite some criticisms, academics defended the imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the code was a buggy mess. retrospective evaluation of lockdowns and computer modeling has verified that they have significantly contributed to reducing mortality and morbidity from covid.a notable opponent of lockdowns has included swedens state epidemiologist anders tegnell, who has frequently criticised the strategy. the swedish governments approach has included minimal restrictions and has been controversial in part due to the relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission. however, the swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown in early .while arguing in august  for the need for further lockdowns in the united states, physicians ranu dhillon and abraar karan argued for smarter lockdowns that impose restrictions on areas with high levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in these locations to offset the economic costs.a number of medical experts signed the great barrington declaration in october  which called for focused protection on high risk groups and minimal restrictions on the general population to achieve herd immunity through covid infection. however, the majority of medical experts and the who have strongly criticised this proposed strategy for its lack of scientific basis and for being unethical. the declaration has also attracted controversy over its funding and the authenticity of its signatures.

some commentators have suggested that states use of emergency powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in longterm democratic backsliding. centralization of power by political leadership in hungary, poland, china and cambodia in response to the covid pandemic have been cited as examples.some researchers have noted that covid pandemic restrictions have come with mental health costs, compounded by those caused by the covid pandemic itself.due to their closure, educational institutions worldwide transitioned to online learning. teachers and faculty had to learn new ways to engage with students while in a covid pandemic. examples of online teaching tools are podcasts, videos, and virtual classrooms.un women warned in an april  report that covid pandemic restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase in domestic violence. many women were being forced to lockdown at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible. for instance, in france there was around a  spike in cases of since the lockdown in march .

some economists supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction. they agreed that lockdowns should continue until the threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the economic impact. there was a general agreement, at least in some economic circles, that severe lockdowns  including closing nonessential businesses and strict limitations on peoples movement  are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures.

both the world food programme  and the world health organization  have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on livelihoods and food security, and david nabarro, who special envoy on covid stated in october  that lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.

there have also been a number of protests worldwide in opposition to lockdowns, including in the united kingdom, the united states, australia, germany, the netherlands, canada and new zealand. the motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied. some have been spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy theories and antivaccination.

in the s, depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that role. after becoming a teen idol in  jump street, he publicly protested against the image, and with his subsequent film and public relations choices began to cultivate a new public persona. the sydney morning herald characterized depp in the s as the bad boy of hollywood; depps chain smoking, recreational drug use and drinking habits were generally documented during this time. according to the guardian journalist hadley freeman in 

along with phoenix and keanu reeves, he was part of a holy trinity of grunge heartthrobs. they were the opposite of the beverly hills,  boys, or brad pitt and dicaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. ...this uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness softened that edge. they signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. we fans understood that there was more to depp, phoenix and reeves than handsomeness. they were artisticthey had bandsand they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. if we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls.

similarly, film scholar anna everett has described depps s films and public persona as antimacho and genderbending, going against the conventions of a hollywood leading man. after  jump street, depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as edward scissorhands. critics often described depps characters as iconic loners or gentle outsiders. according to depp, his onetime agent, tracey jacobs of united talent agency , had to take a lot of heat over the years for his role choices; depp characterized higherups at uta as thinking, jesus christ when does he do a movie where he kisses the girl when does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody when does he get to be a fucking man for a change when is he finally going to do a blockbuster depp also cultivated the image of a bad boy. according to everett, his rulebreaking roles matched with the much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to depps own personal life throughout the decade. from reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel kate moss and hollywood starlet winona ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his nonconformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters.

by , marvel entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through paramount pictures. in june , marvel studios raised secured funding from a  million revolving credit facility with merrill lynch. marvels plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film.in november , marvel studios president kevin feige said that in an ideal world releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, saying its a nice rhythm in that format. while not always the case, as evident by the  releases of iron man  and thor the dark world, he said it is certainly something to aim for. feige expanded on this in july , saying, i dont know that well keep to that model every year, but were doing that in  and , so i think it would be fun to continue that sort of thing. after the reveal of multiple release dates for films through  in july , in which some had three films scheduled, feige stated there was not a number cruncher telling the studio to increase their film output, but rather it was about managing existing franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we dont have a slot wed rather find a way to keep that going. after the titles were revealed in october , feige said, the studios firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year in  and  instead of just two, without changing our methods. on the potential for superhero fatigue, feige stated, though each of the films are based on the marvel comics and feature the marvel studios logo, he believed each film had their own distinctions to help differentiate them from other mcu and superhero films. for example, he noted how the  releases of the studio, captain america civil war and doctor strange, were two completely different movies. the studio hoped to continue to surprise audiences and ensure the studio was not falling into things becoming too similar.in february , feige stated that marvel studios wants to mimic the rhythm that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like a big event or crossover series, with avengers films acting as big, giant linchpins. on expanding the characters in the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having avenger teamups outside of avengers films, feige stated, it is about teaching the general moviegoing audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that theres just a time when they should be together and theres a time when theyre not.in april , on moving the universe to phase four and reflecting on the first three, feige said, i think there will be a finality to moments of phase three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a very different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases. frequent director joe russo added phase three was the deconstruction phase of the mcu, beginning with captain america civil war  leading into the culmination films of avengers infinity war  and avengers endgame . a year later, feige felt after the conclusion of phase three, marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, it might be a new thing. feige mentioned that avengers endgame would provide a definitive end to the films and storylines preceding it, with the franchise having two distinct periods. everything before endgame and everything after. many of the planned films following endgame were intentionally completely different from the films in the infinity saga.in july , feige announced the phase four slate at san diego comiccon, consisting of films and television event series on disney. in december , at disneys investor day, marvel studios provided updates to previously announced films for the phase. in late june , feige said that as phase four was nearing its conclusion, he felt audiences would begin to see where the next saga of the mcu would be heading, and added that there had been many clues throughout the phase to what that would be. he said marvel studios would be a little more direct on their future plans in the following months to provide audiences with the bigger picture so they can see a tiny, tiny bit more of the roadmap. in july , feige unveiled the phase five and six slates at san diego comiccon, similarly consisting of films and disney series, and revealed that these three phases would make up the multiverse saga.on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, feige said in september  there are broad strokes, though sometimes superspecific things. he continued that there was enough leeway to have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up and that each film would feel satisfying on its own, but still interconnected to the larger universe and as if it had been planned years ahead of time. the studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or reacquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in february  with spiderman.

five years into the marriage, the couples incompatibility and age difference of twelve years became visible and damaging. in  diana began a relationship with james hewitt, the familys former riding instructor and in the same year, charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend camilla parker bowles. the media speculated that hewitt, not charles, was harrys father based on the alleged physical similarity between hewitt and harry, but hewitt and others have denied this. harry was born two years before hewitt and diana began their affair.by  cracks in the marriage had become visible and the couples unhappiness and cold attitude towards one another were being reported by the press, who dubbed them the glums because of their evident discomfort in each others company. in  diana was at a birthday party for parker bowless sister, annabel elliot, when she confronted parker bowles about her and charless extramarital affair. these affairs were later exposed in  with the publication of andrew mortons book, diana her true story. the book, which also revealed dianas allegedly suicidal unhappiness, caused a media storm. in , james colthurst conducted secret interviews with diana in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties. these recordings were later used as a source for mortons book. during her lifetime, both diana and morton denied her direct involvement in the writing process and maintained that family and friends were the books main source, however, after her death morton acknowledged dianas role in writing the tellall in the books updated edition, diana her true story in her own words.the queen and prince philip hosted a meeting between charles and diana and unsuccessfully tried to effect a reconciliation. philip wrote to diana and expressed his disappointment at the extramarital affairs of both her and charles; he asked her to examine their behaviour from the others point of view. diana reportedly found the letters difficult, but nevertheless appreciated that he was acting with good intent. it was alleged by some people, including dianas close friend simone simmons, that diana and philip had a tense relationship; however, other observers said their letters provided no sign of friction between them. philip later issued a statement, publicly denying the allegations of him insulting diana.during  and , leaked tapes of telephone conversations reflected negatively on both charles and diana. tape recordings of diana and james gilbey were made public in august , and transcripts were published the same month. the article, squidgygate, was followed in november  by the leaked camillagate tapes, intimate exchanges between charles and parker bowles, published in the tabloids. in december , the prime minister, john major, announced the couples amicable separation to the house of commons.

between  and , diana hired a voice coach, peter settelen, to help her develop her public speaking voice. in a videotape recorded by settelen in , diana said that in  through to , she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. it is thought she was referring to barry mannakee, who was transferred to the diplomatic protection squad in  after his managers had determined that his relationship with diana had been inappropriate. diana said in the tape that mannakee had been chucked out from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair. penny junor suggested in her  book that diana was in a romantic relationship with mannakee. dianas friends dismissed the claim as absurd. in the subsequently released tapes, diana said she had feelings for that someone, saying i was quite happy to give all this up and just to go off and live with him. she described him as the greatest friend shes ever had, though she denied any sexual relationship with him. she also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that he made me feel so inadequate in every possible way, that each time i came up for air he pushed me down again.although she blamed parker bowles for her marital troubles, diana began to believe her husband had been involved in other affairs. in october  diana wrote to her butler paul burrell, telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant tiggy leggebourkewho was also his sons former nannyand was planning to have her killed to make the path clear for him to marry tiggy. leggebourke had been hired by charles as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care, and diana was resentful of leggebourke and her relationship with the young princes. charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with jonathan dimbleby on  june . in the interview, he said he had rekindled his relationship with parker bowles in  only after his marriage to diana had irretrievably broken down. in the same year, dianas affair with hewitt was exposed in detail in the book princess in love by anna pasternak, with hewitt acting as the main source. diana was evidently disturbed and outraged when the book was released, although pasternak claimed hewitt had acted with dianas support to avoid having the affair covered in andrew mortons second book. in the same year, the news of the world claimed that diana had had an affair with the married art dealer oliver hoare. according to hoares obituary, there was little doubt she had been in a relationship with him. however, diana denied any romantic relationship with hoare, whom she described as a friend. she was also linked by the press to the rugby union player will carling and private equity investor theodore j. forstmann, yet these claims were neither confirmed nor proven.

diana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals. she was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to charles until her death, and was often described as the worlds most photographed woman. she was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and highprofile charity work, as well as her illfated marriage. biographer sarah bradford commented, the only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the prince of wales ... the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair. despite all the marital issues and scandals, diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval. dianas former private secretary patrick jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out charles was not able to reconcile with his wifes extraordinary popularity, a viewpoint supported by the biographer tina brown. he also said she was a tough boss who was equally quick to appreciate hard work but could also be defiant if she felt she had been the victim of injustice. dianas mother also defined her as a loving figure who could occasionally be tempestuous. she was often described as a devoted mother to her children, who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life.in the early years, diana was often noted for her shy nature. journalist michael white perceived her as being smart, shrewd and funny. those who communicated with her closely described her as a person who was led by her heart. in an article for the guardian, monica ali believed that, despite being inexperienced and uneducated, diana could handle the expectations of the royal family and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life. ali also believed that she had a lasting influence on the public discourse, particularly in matters of mental health by discussing her eating disorder publicly. according to tina brown, in her early years diana possessed a passive power, a quality that in her opinion she shared with the queen mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals.diana was known for her encounters with sick and dying patients, and the poor and unwanted whom she used to comfort, an action that earned her more popularity. known for her easygoing attitude, she reportedly hated formality in her inner circle, asking people not to jump up every time she enters the room. diana is often credited with widening the range of charity works carried out by the royal family in a more modern style. eugene robinson of the washington post wrote in an article that diana imbued her role as royal princess with vitality, activism and, above all, glamour. alicia carroll of the new york times described diana as a breath of fresh air who was the main reason the royal family was known in the united states. in anthony holdens opinion, diana was visibly reborn after her separation from charles, a point in her life that was described by holden as her moment of triumph, which put her on an independent path to success.dianas sudden death brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning, and subsequently a crisis arose in the royal household. andrew marr said that by her death she revived the culture of public sentiment. her son, prince william, has stated that the outpouring of public grief after her death changed the british psyche, for the better, while alastair campbell noted that it assisted in diminishing the stiff upper lip approach. in  diana was one of the runnersup for time magazines person of the year, and in  the magazine included dianas name on its list of  women of the year. she was chosen as the woman of the year  for her efforts in destigmatising the conditions surrounding hiv/aids patients. in  diana ranked third on the bbcs poll of the  greatest britons, above the queen and other british monarchs.despite being regarded as an iconic figure and a popular member of the royal family, diana was subject to criticism during her life. diana was criticised by philosophy professor anthony ohear who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was selfindulgent in her philanthropic efforts. following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by diana defended her, and peter luff called ohears comments distasteful and inappropriate. further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in return demeaned her royal office. dianas unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media.dianas relationship with the press and the paparazzi has been described as ambivalent. on different occasions she would complain about the way she was being treated by the media, mentioning that their constant presence in her proximity had made life impossible for her, whereas at other times she would seek their attention and hand information to reporters herself. writing for the guardian, peter conrad suggested that it was diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power. this view was supported by christopher hitchens, who believed that in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life, she became an assiduous leaker to the press. tina brown argued that diana was in no way a vulnerable victim of media manipulation, and she found it offensive to present the canny, resourceful diana as a woman of no agency. former news of the world royal editor clive goodman, who later hacked the phones of dianas sons on several occasions, stated in a court in  that in  diana sent a confidential directory which contained numbers of senior members of the royal household to their office to get back at her then husband. nevertheless, diana also used the medias interest in her to shine light on her charitable efforts and patronages.sally bedell smith characterised diana as unpredictable, egocentric, and possessive. smith also argued that in her desire to do charity works, diana was motivated by personal considerations, rather than by an ambitious urge to take on a societal problem. eugene robinson, however, said that diana was serious about the causes she espoused. according to sarah bradford, diana looked down on the house of windsor, whom she reportedly viewed as jumpedup foreign princelings and called them the germans. tony blair characterised diana as a manipulative person and extraordinarily captivating.in an article written for the independent in , journalist yvonne roberts observed the sudden change in peoples opinion of diana after her death from critical to complimentary, a viewpoint supported by theodore dalrymple, who also noticed the sudden shift. roberts also added that diana was neither a saint nor a revolutionary figure, but may have encouraged some people to tackle issues such as landmines, aids and leprosy. while analysing the impact of dianas death and her popularity from a gendered point of view, the british historian ludmilla jordanova said no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women. jordanova also observed that it is better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings. the author anne applebaum believed that diana had not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by jonathan freedland of the guardian who believed that dianas memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while peter conrad, another guardian contributor, argued that even in a decade after her death, she is still not silent, and allan massie of the telegraph believed that dianas sentiments continue to shape our society. writing for the guardian, monica ali described diana as fascinating and flawed. her legacy might be mixed, but its not insubstantial. her life was brief, but she left her mark.

diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world. in , time included diana on its alltime  fashion icons list. iain hollingshead of the telegraph wrote diana had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them. an early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with charles in  when sales of hunter wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the balmoral estate. according to designers and people who worked with diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate. diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends.the princesss fashion combined classically royal expectations with contemporary fashion trends in britain. while on diplomatic trips, her clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries costumes, and while offduty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. she was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, it was something that really mattered to her, according to anna harvey, a former british vogue editor and dianas fashion mentor. her fashion sense originally incorporated decorous and romantic elements, with pastel shades and lush gowns. elements of her fashion rapidly became trends. she forwent certain traditions, such as wearing gloves during engagements, and sought to create a wardrobe that helped her to connect with the public. according to donatella versace who worked closely with diana alongside her brother, dianas interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her marital separation. her style subsequently grew bolder and more businesslike, featuring structured skirt suits, sculptural gowns, and neutral tones designed to reflect attention toward her charity work.catherine walker was among dianas favourite designers with whom she worked to create her royal uniform. among her favoured designers were versace, armani, chanel, dior, gucci and clarks. her famous outfits include the black sheep sweater, the revenge dress, which she wore after charless admission of adultery, and the travolta dress. copies of dianas british voguefeatured pink chiffon blouse by david and elizabeth emanuel, which appeared in the magazine on her engagement announcement day, sold in the millions. she appeared on three british vogue covers during her lifetime and was featured on its october  issue posthumously. diana did her own makeup for events, and was accompanied by a hairstylist for public appearances. in the s, diana was frequently photographed clutching distinctive handbags manufactured by gucci and dior, which became known as the gucci diana and lady dior.following the opening of an exhibition of dianas clothes and dresses at kensington palace in , catherine bennett of the guardian said such exhibitions are among the suitable ways to commemorate public figures whose fashion styles were noted due to their achievements. the exhibition suggests to detractors who, like many other princesses, looking lovely in different clothes was pretty much her lifes work which also brings interest in her clothing. versace also pointed out that she doesnt think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what diana did. one of dianas favourite milliners, john boyd, said diana was our best ambassador for hats, and the entire millinery industry owes her a debt. boyds pink tricorn hat diana wore for her honeymoon was later copied by milliners across the world and credited with rebooting an industry in decline for decades.

in , he was enstooled as the sarkin waka of kwara in the nigerian chieftaincy system.

the wreck of the titanic lies at a depth of about , feet , about  nautical miles  southsoutheast off the coast of newfoundland. it lies in two main pieces about , feet  apart. the bow is still recognisable with many preserved interiors, despite deterioration and damage sustained hitting the sea floor. in contrast, the stern is completely ruined. a debris field around the wreck contains hundreds of thousands of items spilled from the ship as she sank. the bodies of the passengers and crew would have also been distributed across the sea bed, but have since been consumed by other organisms.

the titanic sank in , when she collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. numerous expeditions unsuccessfully tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of finding the wreckage. in , the wreck was finally located by a joint frenchamerican expedition led by jeanlouis michel of ifremer and robert ballard of the woods hole oceanographic institution. the wreck has been the focus of intense interest and has been visited by numerous tourist and scientific expeditions, including by the submersible titan, which imploded near the wreck in june , killing all five aboard.

controversial salvage operations have recovered thousands of items from the titanic, which have been conserved and put on public display. many schemes have been proposed to raise the wreck, including filling it with pingpong balls, injecting it with , tons of vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it in an iceberg that would float to the surface. however, the wreck is too fragile to be raised and is protected by a unesco convention.

almost immediately after the titanic sank on  april , proposals were advanced to salvage  it from its resting place in the north atlantic ocean, despite her exact location and condition being unknown. the families of several wealthy victims of the disaster  the guggenheims, astors, and wideners  formed a consortium and contracted the merritt and chapman derrick and wrecking company to raise the titanic. the project was soon abandoned as impractical as the divers could not even reach a significant fraction of the necessary depth, where the pressure is over , pounds per square inch , about  standard atmospheres. the lack of submarine technology at the time as well as the outbreak of world war i also put off such a project. the company considered dropping dynamite on the wreck to dislodge bodies which would float to the surface, but finally gave up after oceanographers suggested that the extreme pressure would have compressed the bodies into gelatinous lumps. in fact, this was incorrect. whale falls, a phenomenon not discovered until coincidentally, by the same submersible used for the first crewed expedition to the titanic the year beforedemonstrate that waterfilled corpses, in this case cetaceans, can sink to the bottom essentially intact. the high pressure and low temperature of the water would have prevented significant quantities of gas forming during decomposition, preventing the bodies of titanic victims from rising back to the surface.in later years, numerous proposals were put forward to salvage the titanic. however, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, a lack of funding and, in many cases, a lack of understanding of the physical conditions at the wreck site. charles smith, a denver architect, proposed in march  to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wrecks steel hull. having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch the titanic to the surface. an estimated cost of us. million  and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. another proposal involved raising the titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.

in the mids, a hosiery worker from baldock, england, named douglas woolley devised a plan to find the titanic using a bathyscaphe and raise the wreck by inflating nylon balloons that would be attached to her hull. the declared objective was to bring the wreck into liverpool and convert it to a floating museum. the titanic salvage company was established to manage the scheme and a group of businessmen from west berlin set up an entity called titanictresor to support it financially. the project collapsed when its proponents found they could not overcome the problem of how the balloons would be inflated in the first place. calculations showed that it could take ten years to generate enough gas to overcome the water pressure.a variety of proposals to salvage the ship were made during the s. one called for , tons of molten wax  to be pumped into the titanic, lifting her to the surface. another proposal involved filling the titanic with pingpong balls, but overlooked the fact that the balls would be crushed by the pressure long before reaching the depth of the wreck. a similar idea involving the use of benthos glass spheres, which could survive the pressure, was scuppered when the cost of the number of spheres required was put at over  million. an unemployed haulage contractor from walsall named arthur hickey proposed to encase the titanic inside an iceberg, freezing the water around the wreck in a buoyant jacket of ice. the ice, being less dense than liquid water, would float to the surface and could be towed to shore. the boc group calculated that this would require half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to be pumped down to the sea bed. in his  thriller raise the titanic, author clive cusslers hero dirk pitt repairs the holes in the titanics hull, pumps it full of compressed air and succeeds in making it leap out of the waves like a modern submarine blowing its ballast tanks, a scene depicted on the posters of the subsequent film of the book. although this was an artistically stimulating highlight of the film, made using a foot  model of the titanic, it would not have been physically possible. at the time of the books writing, it was still believed that the titanic sank in one piece.

robert ballard of the woods hole oceanographic institution had long been interested in finding the titanic. despite early negotiations with possible backers being abandoned when it emerged that they wanted to turn the wreck into souvenir paperweights, more sympathetic backers joined ballard to form a company named seasonics international ltd. as a vehicle for rediscovering and exploring the titanic. in october , he made his first attempt to find the ship with the aid of the alcoa corporations deep sea salvage vessel seaprobe. this was essentially a drillship with sonar equipment and cameras attached to the end of the drilling pipe. it could lift objects from the seabed using a remotecontrolled mechanical claw. the expedition ended in failure when the drilling pipe broke, sending , feet  of pipe and us,  worth of electronics plunging to the sea bed.in , the walt disney company and national geographic magazine considered mounting a joint expedition to find the titanic, using the aluminium submersible aluminaut. the titanic would have been well within the submersibles depth limits, but the plans were abandoned for financial reasons.the next year, the british billionaire financier and tycoon sir james goldsmith set up seawise  titanic salvage ltd. with the involvement of underwater diving and photographic experts. his aim was to use the publicity of finding the titanic to promote his newly established magazine, now. an expedition to the north atlantic was scheduled for  but was cancelled due to financial difficulties. a year later, now folded after  issues with goldsmith incurring huge financial losses.fred koehler, an electronics repairman from coral gables, florida, sold his electronics shop to finance the completion of a twoman deepsea submersible called seacopter. he planned to dive to the titanic, enter the hull and retrieve a fabulous collection of diamonds rumoured to be contained in the pursers safe. however, he was unable to obtain financial backing for his planned expedition. another proposal involved using a semisubmersible platform mounted with cranes, resting on two watertight supertankers, that would winch the wreck off the seabed and carry it to shore.

on  july , an expedition sponsored by texan oilman jack grimm set off from port everglades, florida, in the research vessel h.j.w. fay. grimm had previously sponsored expeditions to find noahs ark, the loch ness monster, bigfoot, and the giant hole in the north pole predicted by the pseudoscientific hollow earth hypothesis. to raise funds for his titanic expedition, he obtained sponsorship from friends with whom he played poker, sold media rights through the william morris agency, commissioned a book, and obtained the services of orson welles to narrate a documentary. he acquired scientific support from columbia university by donating , to the lamontdoherty geological observatory for the purchase of a widesweep sonar, in exchange for five years use of the equipment and the services of technicians to support it. drs. william b. f. ryan of columbia university and fred spiess of scripps institution of oceanography in california joined the expedition as consultants. the expedition was almost cancelled when grimm asked them to use a monkey trained to point at a spot on the map to supposedly indicate where the titanic was. the scientists issued an ultimatum its either us or the monkey. grimm preferred the monkey, but was prevailed upon to take the scientists instead.the results were inconclusive, as three weeks of surveying in almost continuous bad weather during july and august  failed to find the titanic. the problem was exacerbated by technological limitations; the sea marc sonar used by the expedition had a relatively low resolution and was a new and untested piece of equipment. it was nearly lost only  hours after it was first deployed when the tail was ripped off during a sharp turn, destroying the magnetometer, which would have been vital for detecting the titanics hull. nonetheless, it surveyed an area of some  square nautical miles  and identified  possible targets.  a documentary of this expedition, featuring welles, was titled search for the titanic .grimm mounted a second expedition in june  aboard the research vessel gyre, with spiess and ryan again joining the expedition. to increase their chances of finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the scripps deep tow. the weather was again very poor, but all  of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. on the last day of the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. grimm announced on his return to boston that the titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.  a documentary of this expedition, featuring james drury, was titled return to the titanic . this and the previous film were later combined into a single production, in search of titanic .

in july , grimm went back a third time with ryan aboard the research vessel robert d. conrad. nothing was found and bad weather brought an early end to the expedition. although they did not know it at the time, the sea marc had passed over the titanic but failed to detect it, while deep tow had passed within  nautical miles  of the wreck.

d. michael harris and jack grimm failed to find the titanic but their expeditions did succeed in producing fairly detailed mapping of the area in which the ship sank. it was clear that the position given in the titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search areas alreadyexpansive size. despite the failure of his  expedition, ballard had not given up hope and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. the new technology was a system called argo / jason. this consisted of a remotely controlled deepsea vehicle called argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take closeup images and gather specimens. the images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the united states navy agreed to sponsor the systems development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmesmany still classifiedfor the navy.the navy commissioned ballard and his team to carry out a monthlong expedition every year for four years, to keep argo / jason in good working condition. it agreed to ballards proposal to use some of the time to search for the titanic once the navys objectives had been met; the search would provide an ideal opportunity to test argo / jason. in  the navy sent ballard and argo to map the wrecks of the sunken nuclear submarines uss thresher and uss scorpion, lost in the north atlantic at depths of up to , ft . the expedition found the submarines and made an important discovery about how shipwrecks behave as they sink. as thresher and scorpion sank, debris spilled out from them across a wide area of the seabed and was sorted by the currents, so that light debris drifted furthest away from the site of the sinking. this debris field was far larger than the wrecks themselves. by following the cometlike trail of debris, the main pieces of wreckage could be found.a second expedition to map the wreck of scorpion was mounted in . only twelve days search time would be left at the end of the expedition to look for the titanic. as harris/grimms unsuccessful efforts had taken more than forty days, ballard decided that extra help would be needed. he approached the french national oceanographic agency, ifremer, with which woods hole had previously collaborated. the agency had recently developed a highresolution sidescan sonar called sar and agreed to send a research vessel, le suroît, to survey the sea bed in the area where the titanic was believed to lie. the idea was for the french to use the sonar to find likely targets, and then for the americans to use argo to check out the targets and hopefully confirm whether they were in fact the wreck. the french team spent five weeks, from  july to  august , mowing the lawn  sailing back and forth across the squarenauticalmile  target area to scan the sea bed in a series of stripes. however, they found nothing; though it turned out that they had passed within a few hundred yards of the titanic in their first run.ballard realised that looking for the wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic, drawing on the experience of the surveys of thresher and scorpion; he would look for the debris field instead, using argos cameras rather than sonar. while sonar could not distinguish humanmade debris on the sea bed from natural objects, cameras could. the debris field would also be a far bigger target, stretching one nautical mile  or longer, whereas the titanic itself was only  feet  wide. the search required roundtheclock towing of argo back and forth above the sea bed, with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris. after a weeks fruitless searching, at  am on sunday  september , pieces of debris began to appear on knorrs screens. one of them was identified as a boiler, identical to those shown in pictures from . the following day, the main part of the wreck was found and argo sent back the first pictures of the titanic since her sinking  years before. the discovery made headlines around the world.

following his discovery of the wreck site, ballard returned to the titanic in july  aboard the research vessel rv atlantis ii. now the deepdiving submersible dsv alvin could take people back to the titanic for the first time since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle jason jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. another system, angus, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. jason jr. descended the ruined grand staircase as far as b deck, and photographed remarkably wellpreserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.between  july and  september , an expedition mounted by ifremer and a consortium of american investors which included george tulloch, g. michael harris, d. michael harris and ralph white made  dives to the titanic using the submersible nautile. controversially, they salvaged and brought ashore more than , objects. a joint russiancanadianamerican expedition took place in  using the research vessel akademik mstislav keldysh and its two mir submersibles. sponsored by stephen low and imax, cbs, national geographic and others, the expedition carried out extensive scientific research with a crew of  scientists and engineers. the mirs carried out  dives, spending over  hours at the bottom, shooting , feet  of imax film. this was used to create the  documentary film titanica, which was later released in the us on dvd in a reedited version narrated by leonard nimoy.ifremer and rms titanic inc., the successors to the sponsors of the  expedition, returned to the wreck with nautile and the rov robin in june . over the course of fifteen days, nautile made fifteen dives lasting between eight and twelve hours each. another  artefacts were recovered during the expedition including a twotonne piece of a reciprocating engine, a lifeboat davit and the steam whistle from the ships forward funnel.in , ,  and  rms titanic inc. carried out an intensive series of dives that led to the recovery of over , items in the first two expeditions alone. the  expedition controversially attempted to raise a section of the titanic itself, a section of the outer hull that originally comprised part of the wall of two firstclass cabins on c deck, extending down to d deck. it weighed  tons, measured  by  feet  and had four portholes in it, three of which still had glass in them. the section had come loose either during the sinking or as a result of the impact with the sea bed.its recovery using dieselfilled flotation bags was turned into something of an entertainment event, with two cruise ships accompanying the expedition to the wreck site. passengers were offered the chance, at , per person, to watch the recovery on television screens in their cabins while enjoying luxury accommodation, las vegasstyle shows, and casino gambling aboard the ships. various celebrities were recruited to enliven the proceedings, including burt reynolds, debbie reynolds and buzz aldrin, and grand receptions for vips were scheduled onshore where the hull section would be displayed.however the lift ended disastrously when rough weather caused the ropes supporting the bags to snap. at the moment the ropes broke, the hull section had been lifted to within only  feet  of the surface. it hurtled , feet  back down, embedding itself upright on the sea floor. the attempt was strongly criticised by marine archaeologists, scientists, and historians as a moneymaking publicity stunt; several publications compared the event to grave robbing, and ballard called the event a carnival and stated that we tried to put it to rest, but this perpetuates the tragedy. a second, successful attempt to lift the fragment was carried out in . the socalled big piece was conserved in a laboratory in santa fe for two years before being put on display at the luxor las vegas hotel and casino.in , canadian director james cameron chartered the akademik mstislav keldysh and the mirs to make  dives to the titanic. he used the footage in his blockbuster  film titanic. the discovery of the wreck and a national geographic documentary of ballards  expedition had inspired him to write a synopsis in  of what eventually became the film do story with bookends of present day scene of wreck using submersibles intercut with memories of a survivor and recreated scenes of the night of the sinking. a crucible of human values under stress.

the  expedition by rms titanic inc. carried out  dives during which over  artefacts were recovered, including the ships engine telegraphs, perfume vials and watertight door gears.in , an american coupledavid leibowitz and kimberly millercaused controversy when they were married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of the titanic, in a deliberate echo of a famous scene from james camerons  film. the wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a british company called subsea explorer which had offered a free dive to the titanic that leibowitz had won. he asked whether his fiancée could come too and was told that she couldbut only if she agreed to get married during the trip.the same company also brought along philip littlejohn, the grandson of one of the titanics surviving crew members, who became the first descendant of a titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. cameron himself also returned to the titanic in  to carry out filming for walt disney pictures ghosts of the abyss, filmed in d.in  and , the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration carried out two expeditions to the titanic. the first, carried out between  june and  july , performed four dives in two days. its key aims were to assess the current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. the stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. the microbial colonies aboard the titanic were also a key focus of investigation. the second expedition, from  may   june , saw the return of robert ballard to the titanic nearly  years after he discovered it. the expedition spent  days on the wreck, carrying out highresolution mapping using video and stereoscopic still images.in  there were two expeditions to the titanic. james cameron returned for the third and last time to film last mysteries of the titanic. another expedition searched for previously unseen pieces of wreckage, and led to the documentary titanics final moments missing pieces.

rms titanic inc. mounted further expeditions to the titanic in  and , when the first comprehensive map of the entire debris field was produced. two autonomous underwater vehiclestorpedoshaped robotsrepeatedly ran backward and forward across the bynauticalmile  debris field, taking sonar scans and over , highresolution images. this enabled a detailed photomosaic of the debris field to be created for the first time, giving scientists a much clearer view of the dynamics of the ships sinking. the expedition encountered difficulties several hurricanes passed over the wreck site, and the remora rov was caught in a piece of wreckage. this same year saw the discovery of the new bacteria living in the rusticles on the titanic, halomonas titanicae.tourist and scientific visits to the titanic still continue; by april ,  years since the disaster and nearly  since the discovery of the wreck, around  people had visited. on  april  , the wreck of the titanic became eligible for protection under the  unesco convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage. in the same month, robert ballard, the wrecks discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the titanic by using deepsea robots to paint the wreck with antifouling paint, to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. the proposed plan that ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the titanics th sinking anniversary called save the titanic with bob ballard where ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw original antifouling paint on the ships hull, which was still working even after  years on the seabed when he visited the titanic in .in august , a team of explorers and scientists used deepsubmergence vehicle limiting factor to visit the wreck, marking the first crewed dive to the ship in  years. five dives took place over a period of eight days. the team used specially adapted cameras to capture the wreck in k resolution for the first time, and dedicated photogrammetry passes were performed to create highly accurate and photoreal d models of the wreck. footage from the dive was used for a documentary film by atlantic productions. the documentary, back to the titanic, aired on national geographic in .in may , the mapping company magellan and the film production company atlantic productions created the first fullsized digital scan of the titanic, using deepsea mapping. the d view of the entire ship enables it to be seen as if the water has been drained away. it is hoped the scan can shed new light on the sinking.american company oceangate began conducting commercial submersible tours of the wreck in july  using its submersible titan. on  june , titan imploded near the wreck during a dive, killing its pilot and four passengers.

the location of the wreck is a considerable distance from the location transmitted by the ships wireless operators before she went down. the titanic is in two main pieces  nautical miles  southeast of mistaken point, newfoundland and labrador. the boilers found by argo, which mark the point at which the ship went down, are about  feet  east of the stern. the two main parts of the wreck of the titanic present a striking contrast. although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. it is now clear that the stresses on the titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.

the bow section, which measures about  feet  long, is thought to have descended at an angle of about . its distance from the stern was caused by its planing forward horizontally by about  ft for every  ft  of its descent. during the descent to the sea bed, the funnels were swept away, taking with them the rigging and large lengths of cables. these dragged along the boat deck, tearing away many of the davits and much of the other deck equipment. the foremast was also torn down, falling onto the port bridge area. the ships wheelhouse was swept away, possibly after being hit by the falling foremast.the bow hit the bottom at a speed of about  knots , digging about  feet  deep into the mud, up to the base of the anchors. the impact bent the hull in two places and caused it to buckle downwards by about  under the forward well deck cranes and by about  under the forward expansion joint. when the bow section hit the sea bed, the weakened decks at the rear, where the ship had broken apart, collapsed on top of each other. the forward hatch cover was also blown off and landed a couple of hundred feet in front of the bow, possibly due to the force of water being pushed out as the bow impacted the bottom.the area around the bridge is particularly badly damaged; as robert ballard has put it, it looks as if it had been squashed by a giants fist. the roof of the officers quarters and the sides of the gymnasium appear pushed in, railings were bent outwards and vertical steel columns supporting the decks were bent into a cshape. charles r. pellegrino has proposed that this was the result of a downblast of water, caused by a slipstream that had followed the bow section as it fell towards the sea bed. according to pellegrinos hypothesis, when the bow came to an abrupt halt the inertia of the slipstream caused a rapidly moving column of water weighing thousands of tons to strike the top of the wreck, striking it near the bridge. this, argues pellegrino, caused large parts of the bows interior to be demolished by surges of water and violent eddies kicked up by the wrecks sudden halt. the damage caused by the collision with the iceberg is not visible at the bow as it is buried under mud.

despite the exterior devastation caused by the bows descent and collision with the ocean floor, there are parts of the interior in reasonably good condition. the bows slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. the stairwell of the firstclass grand staircase between the boat deck and e deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for rovs. dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.

passenger staterooms have largely deteriorated because they were framed in perishable softwoods such as pine, leaving hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marbletopped washstands. woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawerpulls or pushplates have survived in better condition because of the small electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other organisms. hardwoods like teak and mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, are more resistant to decay. lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters have resisted decay because they were framed in steel.

the only intact public rooms remaining in either the stern or bow sections are the firstclass reception room and dining saloon, both on ddeck. most of the dining saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the breakup point midship, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. the reception room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany panelling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging and there is a deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. the turkish baths on fdeck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in , preserving the bluegreen tiles, carved teak woodwork, and inlaid furniture. the grand staircase was likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding firstclass foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oakframed stanchions.in addition to the passenger areas, crew areas like the firemens mess, dormitories, parts of scotland road on edeck and the cargo holds on the orlop deck have also been explored. the ghosts of the abyss expedition in  attempted to locate the famed renault automobile belonging to william carter, but the cargo was indistinguishable beneath the silt and rusticles.

the stern of the ship, which measures about  feet  long, was catastrophically damaged during the descent and landing on the sea bed. it had not fully filled with water when it sank, and the increasing water pressure caused trapped air pockets to implode, tearing apart the hull. it was loud enough that multiple survivors reported hearing explosions about ten seconds after the stern had sunk beneath the waves. data from a sonar map made during a  expedition showed that the stern rotated like a helicopter blade as it sank.the rudder appears to have swung over to an angle of about  to  during the sterns descent, causing the section to follow a tight spiral to the bottom. it probably struck rudderfirst, burying most of the rudder in the mud up to a depth of  feet . the decks pancaked one atop another and the hull plating splayed out to the sides of the shattered section. the pancaking is so severe that the combined height of the decks, which are piled up on top of the reciprocating engines, is now generally not more than about  to  feet  high. no individual deck is more than about  foot  high.large sections of the hull plating appear to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. one such section, thought to have been from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. the force of the water tore up the poop deck and folded it back on itself. the centre propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about .a large vshaped section of the ship just aft of midships, running from the keel upwards through number  boiler room and upwards to cover the area under funnel numbers three and four, was believed to have disintegrated entirely when the ship broke up. this was one of the weakest parts of the ship as a result of the presence of two large open spaces  the forward end of the engine room and the aft first class passenger staircase. the rest of this part of the ship is scattered across the seabed at distances of  to  feet  from the main part of the stern.during the  expedition to map the wreck site, a major chunk of the deck house  along with pieces of the third funnel were found. this showed that instead of simply disintegrating into a mass of debris, large sections of the ship broke off in chunks and that the ship broke in half between funnel numbers two and three, and not funnel numbers three and four. five of the boilers from number  boiler room came loose during its disintegration and landed in the debris field around the stern. experts believe that this tight cluster of boilers marks the hypocentre of where the ship broke up , feet above. the rest of the boilers are still presumably located in the bow section.

as the titanic broke apart, many objects and pieces of hull were scattered across the sea bed. there are two debris fields in the vicinity of the wreck, each between ,, ft  long, trailing in a southwesterly direction from the bow and stern. they cover an area of about  sq mi . most of the debris is concentrated near the stern section of the titanic. it consists of thousands of objects from the interior of the ship, ranging from tons of coal spilled from ruptured bunkers to suitcases, clothes, corked wine bottles , bathtubs, windows, washbasins, jugs, bowls, hand mirrors and numerous other personal effects. the debris field also includes numerous pieces of the ship itself, with the largest pieces of debris in the vicinity of the partially disintegrated stern section. it is also believed that the remains of the ships four funnels are in one of these debris fields.

prior to the discovery of the titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at , feet  down would preserve the ship virtually intact. the water is bitterly cold at only about  c , there is no light, and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms would not be able to gain a foothold on the wreck. the titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze.the reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in april . her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes  physical, chemical and biological. she is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in titanic canyon, which is swept by the western boundary current. eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. the current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ships hull. salt corrosion eats away at the hull, and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.the most dramatic deterioration has been caused by biological factors. it used to be thought that the depths of the ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mids has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. during the  imax expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around the titanic. a total of  species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail fish up to a yard  long. much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers.some of the titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; james camerons  expedition discovered a previously unknown type of sea cucumber, lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent portholes along its side. a newly discovered species of rusteating bacterium found on the ship has been named halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. henrietta mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as . the canadian geophysicist steve blasco has commented that the wreck has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert. in mid, the facilities of the institut lauelangevin used neutron imaging to demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by halomonas titanicae to regulate fluid balance and cell volume to survive at such pressures and salinities.analysis by henrietta mann and bhavleen kaur, both of dalhousie university in halifax, nova scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the university of seville in spain, has determined that the wreck of the titanic will not exist by  and that preservation of the titanic is impossible. unfortunately, because titanic is . miles  down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. it is film which will preserve it for history now, says mann. it has already lasted for  years, but eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain on the bottom of the atlantic... i think titanic has maybe  or  years left. i dont think it will have too much longer than that. other scientists estimated that the titanic would last no longer than  years, as of .the soft organic material aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull would have been the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. woodboring molluscs such as teredo colonised the ships decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, panelling, doors and staircase banisters. when their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes.the question of the victims bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. when the debris field was surveyed in robert ballards  expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. the flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within the titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or thirdclass cabins. this has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early s at the latest.the molluscs and scavengers did not consume everything organic. some of the wooden objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood that seems to have resisted the borers. the firstclass reception area off the ships grand staircase is still intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. robert ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may not have been able to reach, may still contain human remains. according to charles pellegrino, who dived on the titanic in , a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. it was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.

the longestlasting inhabitants of the titanic are likely to be bacteria and archaea that have colonised the metal hull of the ship. they have produced reddishbrown stalactites of rust hanging down as much as several feet, looking like long needlelike icicles, as ballard has put it. the formations, which ballard dubbed rusticles, are extremely fragile and disintegrate in a cloud of particles if touched. the bacteria consume the iron in the hull, oxidising it and leaving rust particles behind as a waste product. to protect themselves from the seawater, they secrete an acidic viscous slime that flows where gravity takes it, carrying ferric oxides and hydroxides. these form the rusticles.when scientists were able to retrieve a rusticle, it was discovered that it was far more complex than had been imagined, with complex systems of roots infiltrating the metal, interior channels, bundles of fibres, pores and other structures. charles pellegrino comments that they seem more akin to levels of tissue organization found in sponges or mosses and other members of the animal or plant kingdoms. the bacteria are estimated to be consuming the titanics hull at the rate of  pounds  per day, which is about  pounds  per hour or  ounces  per minute. roy collimore, a microbiologist, estimates that the bow alone now supports some  tons of rusticles, and that they will have devoured  of the hull within  years.since the titanics wreck was discovered in , radical changes have been observed in the marine ecosystem around the ship. the  expedition recorded  more brittle stars and sea cucumbers than ballards  expedition, while crinoids and sea squirts had taken root all over the sea bed. red krill had appeared, and an unknown organism had built numerous nests across the seabed from black pebbles. the number of rusticles on the ship had increased greatly. curiously, the same thing had happened over about the same timescale to the wreck of the german battleship bismarck, sunk at a depth of , metres  on the other side of the atlantic. the mud around the ship was found to contain hundreds of different species of animals. the sudden explosion of life around the titanic may be a result of an increased amount of nutrients falling from the surface, possibly a result of human overfishing, eliminating fish that would otherwise have consumed the nutrients.many scientists, including ballard, are concerned that visits by tourists in submersibles and the recovery of artefacts are causing the wreck to decay faster. underwater bacteria have been eating away at the titanics steel and transformed it into rust since the ship sank, but because of the extra damage caused by visitors, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimates that the hull and structure of the ship may collapse to the ocean floor within the next  years. the promenade deck has deteriorated significantly in recent years, partly because of damage caused by submersibles landing on the ship. the mast has almost completely deteriorated and has been stripped of its bell and brass light.

other damage includes a gash on the bow section where block letters once spelled titanic, part of the brass telemotor which once held the ships wooden wheel is now twisted, and the crows nest has completely deteriorated. cameron is responsible for some of the more significant damage during his expedition to the ship in  to acquire footage for his film titanic two years later. one of the mir submersibles used on the expedition collided with the hull, damaging both and leaving fragments of the submersibles propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. captain smiths quarters were heavily damaged by the collapse of the external bulkhead, which exposed the cabins interior.in  an international survey team reported that the wreck had further deteriorated and that the captains bathtub was now lost. a  expedition reported that the tub was not lost but that the once clear view into it was obstructed by debris.

the titanics discovery in  sparked a debate over the ownership of the wreck and the valuable items inside and on the sea bed around it. ballard and his crew did not bring up any artefacts from the wreck, considering such an act to be tantamount to grave robbing. ballard has since argued strongly that it be left unmolested by treasure seekers. as ballard has put it, the development of deepsea submersibles has made the great pyramids of the deep .... accessible to man. he can either plunder them like the grave robbers of egypt or protect them for the countless generations which will follow ours. however, within only two weeks of the discovery, british insurance company the liverpool and london steamship protection and indemnity association claimed that it owned the wreck, and several more schemes to raise it were announced. a belgian entrepreneur offered trips to the titanic for , a head. a british man named douglas faulknerwoolley claims ownership of the titanic, based on a late s ruling by the british board of trade which awarded him ownership of the wreck. the wreck had not been discovered at that time.spurred by ballards appeals for the wreck to be left alone, north carolina congressman walter b. jones sr. introduced the rms titanic maritime memorial act in the united states house of representatives in . it called for strict scientific guidelines to be introduced to govern the exploration and salvage of the titanic and urged the united states secretary of state to lobby canada, the united kingdom and france to pass similar legislation. it passed the house and senate by an overwhelming majority and was signed into law by president ronald reagan on  october . however, the law has been ineffective as the wreck lies outside united states waters, and the act was set aside by the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia, norfolk division, in . although negotiations among the four countries were carried out between  and , the resulting agreement concerning the shipwrecked vessel rms titanic has been ratified by only the us and the uk.

only a few days after ballards discovery of the wreck, jack grimmthe author of the unsuccessful early s attempts to find the titanicclaimed ownership of it on the grounds that he had allegedly been the first to find it. he announced that he intended to begin salvaging the wreck. he said that he couldnt see them just lie there and be absorbed by the ocean floor. what possible harm can salvaging do to this mass of twisted steeltitanic ventures inc., a connecticutbased consortium, cosponsored a survey and salvage operation in  with the french oceanographic agency ifremer. the expedition produced an outcry. titanic survivor eva hart condemned what many saw as the looting of a mass grave to bring up those things from a mass sea grave just to make a few thousand pounds shows a dreadful insensitivity and greed. the grave should be left alone. theyre simply going to do it as fortune hunters, vultures, piratespublic misgivings increased when, on  october , a television program, return to the titanic live, was broadcast from the cité des sciences et de lindustrie in paris, hosted by telly savalas. in front of a live tv audience, a valise recovered from the sea bed was opened, revealing a number of personal items apparently belonging to richard l. beckwith of new york, who survived the sinking. a safe was also opened, revealing a few items of memorabilia and wet banknotes. the tone of the event was described by one commentator as unsympathetic, lacking dignity and finesse, and with all the superficial qualities of a media event.new york times television critic john corry called the event a combination of the sacred and profane and sometimes the downright silly. paul heyer comments that it was presented as a kind of deep sea striptease and that savalas seemed haggard, missed several cues and at one point almost tripped over a chair. controversy persisted after the broadcast when claims were made that the safe had been opened beforehand and that the show had been a fraud.marextitanic inc. was formed in  to launch an expedition to the titanic. marextitanics ceo was james kollar. the company was a subsidiary of marex international, an international marine salvage firm located in memphis, tennessee. in  marex made a bid to seize control of the artefacts and the wreck itself by suing titanic ventures, arguing that the latter had abandoned its claim by not returning to the wreck since the  expedition. it claimed a superior right of salvage based on a pill bottle and hull fragment that were said to have been retrieved by marex. marex simultaneously sent a vessel, the sea mussel, to carry out its own salvage operation.however, the marex artefacts were alleged to have been illegally retrieved by the  russianamericancanadian expedition and marex was issued with a temporary injunction preventing it from carrying out its plans. in october  the injunction was made permanent and the salvage claims of titanic ventures were upheld. the decision was later reversed by an appeals court but marexs claims were not renewed. even so, titanic ventures control of the artefacts recovered in  remained in question until  when a french administrator in the office of maritime affairs of the ministry of equipment, transportation, and tourism awarded the company title to the artefacts.in may , titanic ventures sold its interests in the salvage operations and artefacts to rms titanic inc., a subsidiary of premier exhibitions inc. headed by george tulloch and arnie geller. it had to go through a laborious legal process of having itself legally recognised as the sole and exclusive salvager of the wreck. its claim was opposed for a while by the liverpool and london steamship protection and indemnity association, the titanics former insurer, but was eventually settled. it was awarded ownership and salvaging rights by the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia on  june  in a ruling that declared the company to be the salvor in possession of the wreck.litigation has continued over the artefacts in recent years. in a motion filed on  february , rms titanic inc. requested that the united states district court enter an order awarding it title to all the artefacts  which are the subject of this action pursuant to the law of finds or, in the alternative, a salvage award in the amount of  million. rms titanic inc. excluded from its motion any claim for an award of title to the objects recovered in , but it did request that the district court declare that, based on the french administrative action, the artifacts raised during the  expedition are independently owned by rmst. following a hearing, the district court entered an order dated  july , in which it refused to grant comity or recognise the  decision of the french administrator, and rejected rms titanic inc.s claim that it should be awarded title to the items recovered since  under the maritime law of finds.rms titanic inc. appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit. in its decision of  january  the court recognised explicitly the appropriateness of applying maritime salvage law to historic wrecks such as that of titanic and denied the application of the maritime law of finds. the court also ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the  artifacts, and therefore vacated that part of the courts  july  order. in other words, according to this decision, rms titanic inc. has ownership title to the objects awarded in the french decision  and continues to be salvorinpossession of the titanic wreck. the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court to determine the salvage award .on  march , it was revealed that the fate of , artefacts retrieved from the wreck would rest with a u.s. district judges decision. the ruling was later issued in two decisions on  august  and  august . as announced in , the judge ruled that rms titanic inc. owned the artefacts and her decision dealt with the status of the wreck as well as establishing a monitoring system to check future activity upon the wreck site. on  august , judge rebecca beach smith granted rms titanic, inc. fair market value for the artefacts but deferred ruling on their ownership and the conditions for their preservation, possible disposition and exhibition until a further decision could be reached.on  august , judge smith granted title to thousands of artefacts from the titanic, that rms titanic inc. did not already own under a french court decision concerning the first group of salvaged artefacts, to rms titanic inc. subject to a detailed list of conditions concerning preservation and disposition of the items. the artefacts can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list of conditions and restrictions. rms titanic inc. can profit from the artefacts through exhibiting them.rms titanic inc. has also attempted to secure exclusive physical access to the wreck site. in , it obtained a court order finding that it had the exclusive right to take any and all types of photographic images of the titanic wreck and wreck site. it obtained another order in  against deep ocean expeditions and chris haver, a british virgin islands corporation that aimed to run tourist trips to the titanic at a cost of , per person . this was overturned in march  by the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit, which ruled that the law of salvage did not extend to obtaining exclusive rights to view, visit and photograph a wreck.

the court pointed out that the titanic is located in a public place in international waters, rather than in a private or controllable location to which access could be restricted by the owner. granting such a right would also create a perverse incentive; since the aim of salvage is to carry out a salvage operation, leaving property in place so that it could be photographed would run counter to this objective.

rms titanic inc. has attracted considerable controversy for its approach to the titanic. two rival camps have formed following the wrecks discovery the conservationists, championed by rms titanic inc.s george tulloch , and the protectionists, whose most prominent advocate is robert ballard. the first camp has argued that artefacts from around the wreck should be recovered and conserved, while the latter camp argues that the entire wreck site should have been left undisturbed as a mass grave. both camps agree that the wreck itself should not be salvaged  though rms titanic inc. did not stick to its proclaimed handsoff policy when it managed to demolish the titanics crows nest in the course of retrieving the bell. its predecessor titanic ventures agreed with ifremer that it would not sell any of the artefacts but would put them on public display, for which it could charge an entry fee.tullochs approach has undoubtedly resulted in outcomes that would not have been possible otherwise. in , he presented edith brown haisman, a yearold survivor of the disaster, with her fathers pocket watch, which had been retrieved from the sea bed. she had last seen it on  april , when he waved goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat . they never saw him again, and he presumably went down with the ship. the watch was loaned to haisman for life; when she died five years later, it was reclaimed by rms titanic inc.on another occasion, a steamer trunk spotted in the debris field was found to contain three musical instruments, a deck of playing cards, a diary belonging to one howard irwin, and a bundle of letters from his girlfriend pearl shuttle. it was first thought that irwin, a musician and professional gambler, had boarded the ship under a false identity. there was no record of him being among the passengers, even though a ticket had been purchased for him. it turned out that he had stayed ashore but his trunk had been brought aboard the ship by his friend henry sutehall, who was among the victims of the disaster. the fragile contents of the trunk were preserved by the interiors starvation of oxygen, which prevented bacteria from consuming the paper. very few other shipwrecks have yielded readable paper.on the other hand, the heavily commercialised approach of rms titanic inc. has caused repeated controversy and many have argued that salvaging the titanic is an inherently disrespectful act. the wreck site has been called a tomb and a reliquary, a gravestone for the , people who died and hallowed ground. titanic historians john eaton and charles haas argue that the salvagers are little more than plunderers and armchair salvage experts and others have characterised them as grave robbers. the return to titanic... live television show in  was widely condemned as a circus, though the  expeditions scientific and financial leaders had no control over the show.in a particularly controversial episode, rms titanic inc. sold some , lumps of coal retrieved from the debris field in order to fund the rumoured  million cost of lifting the big piece of the ships hull. it attempted to get around the nosale agreement with ifremer by charging the new owners a  fee to act as conservators, in order to claim that the coal lumps had not actually been sold. this attracted strong criticism from all sides. nonetheless, in  tulloch was ousted by the companys shareholders and was replaced by arnie geller, who promised a more aggressive approach to making a profit. the company declared that it had an absolute right to sell recovered gold, coins and currency. it was prevented from doing this by a court order in the united states and ifremer withdrew its cooperation and its submersibles, threatening a lawsuit.

in january , the united kingdom and united states governments announced that they had agreed to protect the wreckage of the titanic. the agreement, signed by the british government in , came into effect after being ratified by u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo at the end of . uk maritime minister nus ghani said the uk would work with canada and france to bring even more protection to the wreckage.

objects from the titanic have been exhibited for many years, though only a few were retrieved before the discovery of the wreck in . the maritime museum of the atlantic in halifax, nova scotia, has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the canadian search vessels that recovered the victims bodies. various other museums, including the national maritime museum in greenwich and the seacity museum in southampton, have objects donated by survivors and relatives of victims, including some items that were retrieved from the bodies of victims.

more donated titanic artefacts are to be found in the merseyside maritime museum in liverpool and the titanic historical societys museum in indian orchard, springfield, massachusetts. the latters collection includes items such as the life jacket of madeleine astor, the wife of millionaire titanic victim john jacob astor iv, a rivet which was removed from the hull before the titanic went to sea, an ice warning which never reached the bridge, a restaurant menu and a sample square of carpet from a first class stateroom.

rms titanic inc. organises largescale exhibitions around the world of artefacts retrieved from the wreck site. after minor exhibitions were held in paris and scandinavia, the first major exhibition of recovered artefacts was held at the national maritime museum in . it was hugely popular, drawing an average of , visitors a week during the yearlong exhibition. since then, rms titanic inc. has established a largescale permanent exhibition of titanic artefacts at the luxor hotel and casino in las vegas, nevada.

the ,squarefoot  exhibit is the home of the big piece of the hull retrieved in  and features conserved items including luggage, the titanics whistles, floor tiles and an unopened bottle of champagne. the exhibit includes a fullscale replica of the ships grand staircase and part of the promenade deck, and even a mockup of the iceberg. it also runs a travelling exhibition called titanic the artifact exhibition which has opened in various cities around the world and has been seen by over  million people. the exhibition typically runs for six to nine months featuring a combination of artefacts, reconstructions and displays of the ship, her passengers and crew and the disaster itself. in a similar fashion to the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington, d.c., visitors are given a boarding pass in the name of an individual passenger at the start of the exhibition. they do not discover the fate of their assigned passenger until the end.

the vast majority of the relics retrieved by various groups from the titanic were owned by premier exhibitions which operated rms titanic inc. and filed for bankruptcy in . in late august , the groups vying to purchase the , relics included one by museums in england and northern ireland, with assistance from james cameron and some financial support from national geographic. oceanographer robert ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in belfast and in greenwich. a decision as to the outcome was to be made by a united states district court judge in the case titled rms titanic inc., , u.s. bankruptcy court, middle district of florida . on  october , a judge approved the sale of artefacts to a private investor group.

elizabeth i  was queen of england and ireland from  november  until her death in . elizabeth was the last monarch of the house of tudor and is sometimes referred to as the virgin queen.elizabeth was the only surviving daughter of henry viii by anne boleyn, his second wife, who was executed when elizabeth was two years old. annes marriage to henry was annulled, and elizabeth declared illegitimate. henry restored her to the line of succession when she was ten, via the third succession act . after henrys death in , elizabeths younger halfbrother edward vi ruled until his own death in , bequeathing the crown to a protestant cousin, lady jane grey and ignoring the claims of his two halfsisters, the catholic mary and the younger elizabeth, in spite of statutes to the contrary. edwards will was set aside within weeks of his death and mary became queen, deposing and executing jane. during marys reign, elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting protestant rebels.

upon her halfsisters death in , elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by william cecil, whom she created baron burghley. one of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an english protestant church, of which she became the supreme governor. this elizabethan religious settlement was to evolve into the church of england. it was expected that elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. she was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, james vi of scotland, the son of mary, queen of scots.

in government, elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings had been. one of her mottoes was video et taceo . in religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. after the pope declared her illegitimate in , which in theory released english catholics from allegiance to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers secret service, run by francis walsingham. elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of france and spain. she halfheartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the netherlands, france, and ireland. by the mids, england could no longer avoid war with spain.

as she grew older, elizabeth became celebrated for her virginity. a cult of personality grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. elizabeths reign became known as the elizabethan era. the period is famous for the flourishing of english drama, led by playwrights such as william shakespeare and christopher marlowe, the prowess of english maritime adventurers, such as francis drake and walter raleigh, and for the defeat of the spanish armada. some historians depict elizabeth as a shorttempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer  and a dogged survivor  in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. after the short, disastrous reigns of her siblings, her  years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.

elizabeth was born at greenwich palace on  september  and was named after her grandmothers, elizabeth of york and lady elizabeth howard. she was the second child of henry viii of england born in wedlock to survive infancy. her mother was henrys second wife, anne boleyn. at birth, elizabeth was the heir presumptive to the english throne. her elder halfsister mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when henry annulled his marriage to marys mother, catherine of aragon, to marry anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the tudor succession. she was baptised on  september , and her godparents were thomas cranmer, archbishop of canterbury; henry courtenay, st marquess of exeter; elizabeth stafford, duchess of norfolk; and margaret wotton, dowager marchioness of dorset. a canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle george boleyn, viscount rochford; john hussey, st baron hussey of sleaford; lord thomas howard; and william howard, st baron howard of effingham.elizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on  may , four months after catherine of aragons death from natural causes. elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of her place in the royal succession. eleven days after anne boleyns execution, henry married jane seymour. queen jane died the next year shortly after the birth of their son, edward, who was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. elizabeth was placed in her halfbrothers household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.

elizabeths first governess, margaret bryan, wrote that she was as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever i knew any in my life. catherine champernowne, better known by her later, married name of catherine kat ashley, was appointed as elizabeths governess in , and she remained elizabeths friend until her death in . champernowne taught elizabeth four languages french, dutch, italian and spanish. by the time william grindal became her tutor in , elizabeth could write english, latin, and italian. under grindal, a talented and skilful tutor, she also progressed in french and greek. by the age of , she was able to translate her stepmother catherine parrs religious work prayers or meditations from english into italian, latin, and french, which she presented to her father as a new years gift. from her teenage years and throughout her life, she translated works in latin and greek by numerous classical authors, including the pro marcello of cicero, the de consolatione philosophiae of boethius, a treatise by plutarch, and the annals of tacitus. a translation of tacitus from lambeth palace library, one of only four surviving english translations from the early modern era, was confirmed as elizabeths own in , after a detailed analysis of the handwriting and paper was undertaken.after grindal died in , elizabeth received her education under her brother edwards tutor, roger ascham, a sympathetic teacher who believed that learning should be engaging. current knowledge of elizabeths schooling and precocity comes largely from aschams memoirs. by the time her formal education ended in , elizabeth was one of the best educated women of her generation. at the end of her life, she was believed to speak the welsh, cornish, scottish and irish languages in addition to those mentioned above. the venetian ambassador stated in  that she possessed these languages so thoroughly that each appeared to be her native tongue. historian mark stoyle suggests that she was probably taught cornish by william killigrew, groom of the privy chamber and later chamberlain of the exchequer.

henry viii died in  and elizabeths halfbrother, edward vi, became king at the age of nine. catherine parr, henrys widow, soon married thomas seymour, st baron seymour of sudeley, edward vis uncle and the brother of lord protector edward seymour, st duke of somerset. the couple took elizabeth into their household at chelsea. there elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life. thomas seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the yearold elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks. elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits. parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in. twice she accompanied him in tickling elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown into a thousand pieces. however, after parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs. in may , elizabeth was sent away.

thomas seymour nevertheless continued scheming to control the royal family and tried to have himself appointed the governor of the kings person. when parr died after childbirth on  september , he renewed his attentions towards elizabeth, intent on marrying her. her governess kat ashley, who was fond of seymour, sought to convince elizabeth to take him as her husband. she tried to convince elizabeth to write to seymour and comfort him in his sorrow, but elizabeth claimed that thomas was not so saddened by her stepmothers death as to need comfort.

in january , seymour was arrested and imprisoned in the tower on suspicion of conspiring to depose his brother somerset as protector, marry lady jane grey to king edward vi, and take elizabeth as his own wife. elizabeth, living at hatfield house, would admit nothing. her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, robert tyrwhitt, who reported, i do see it in her face that she is guilty. seymour was beheaded on  march .

edward vi died on  july , aged . his will ignored the succession to the crown act , excluded both mary and elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir lady jane grey, granddaughter of henry viiis younger sister mary tudor, queen of france. jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. on  august , mary rode triumphantly into london, with elizabeth at her side.

the show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. mary, a devout catholic, was determined to crush the protestant faith in which elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend catholic mass; elizabeth had to outwardly conform. marys initial popularity ebbed away in  when she announced plans to marry philip of spain, the son of holy roman emperor charles v and an active catholic. discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to marys religious policies.

in january and february , wyatts rebellion broke out; it was soon suppressed. elizabeth was brought to court and interrogated regarding her role, and on  march, she was imprisoned in the tower of london. elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. though it is unlikely that she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. marys closest confidant, emperor charless ambassador simon renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while elizabeth lived; and lord chancellor stephen gardiner, worked to have elizabeth put on trial. elizabeths supporters in the government, including william paget, st baron paget, convinced mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. instead, on  may, elizabeth was moved from the tower to woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of henry bedingfeld. crowds cheered her all along the way.on  april , elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of marys apparent pregnancy. if mary and her child died, elizabeth would become queen, but if mary gave birth to a healthy child, elizabeths chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. when it became clear that mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. elizabeths succession seemed assured.king philip, who ascended the spanish throne in , acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sisterinlaw. she was a better ally than the chief alternative, mary, queen of scots, who had grown up in france and was betrothed to the dauphin of france. when his wife fell ill in , king philip sent the count of feria to consult with elizabeth. this interview was conducted at hatfield house, where she had returned to live in october . by october , elizabeth was already making plans for her government. mary recognised elizabeth as her heir on  november , and elizabeth became queen when mary died on  november.

elizabeth became queen at the age of , and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to hatfield to swear allegiance. the speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval political theology of the sovereigns two bodies the body natural and the body politic

my lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering i am gods creature, ordained to obey his appointment, i will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that i may have assistance of his grace to be the minister of his heavenly will in this office now committed to me. and as i am but one body naturally considered, though by his permission a body politic to govern, so shall i desire you all ... to be assistant to me, that i with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to almighty god and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. i mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.

as her triumphal progress wound through the city on the eve of the coronation ceremony, she was welcomed wholeheartedly by the citizens and greeted by orations and pageants, most with a strong protestant flavour. elizabeths open and gracious responses endeared her to the spectators, who were wonderfully ravished. the following day,  january , a date chosen by her astrologer john dee, elizabeth was crowned and anointed by owen oglethorpe, the catholic bishop of carlisle, in westminster abbey. she was then presented for the peoples acceptance, amidst a deafening noise of organs, fifes, trumpets, drums, and bells. although elizabeth was welcomed as queen in england, the country was still in a state of anxiety over the perceived catholic threat at home and overseas, as well as the choice of whom she would marry.

elizabeths personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars. she was a protestant, but kept catholic symbols , and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key protestant belief.elizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a catholic crusade against heretical england. the queen therefore sought a protestant solution that would not offend catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of english protestants, but she would not tolerate the puritans, who were pushing for farreaching reforms. as a result, the parliament of  started to legislate for a church based on the protestant settlement of edward vi, with the monarch as its head, but with many catholic elements, such as vestments.the house of commons backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the house of lords, particularly from the bishops. elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the archbishopric of canterbury. this enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. nevertheless, elizabeth was forced to accept the title of supreme governor of the church of england rather than the more contentious title of supreme head, which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. the new act of supremacy became law on  may . all public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by mary. at the same time, a new act of uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of the  book of common prayer  compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.

from the start of elizabeths reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom. although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear. historians have speculated that thomas seymour had put her off sexual relationships. she considered several suitors until she was about fifty. her last courtship was with francis, duke of anjou,  years her junior. while risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of king philip ii of spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. however, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.

in the spring of , it became evident that elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend robert dudley. it was said that his wife amy was suffering from a malady in one of her breasts and that the queen would like to marry robert if his wife should die. by the autumn of , several foreign suitors were vying for elizabeths hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in england there is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation ... she will marry none but the favoured robert. amy dudley died in september , from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroners inquest finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen. elizabeth seriously considered marrying dudley for some time. however, william cecil, nicholas throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. there were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.among other marriage candidates being considered for the queen, robert dudley continued to be regarded as a possible candidate for nearly another decade. elizabeth was extremely jealous of his affections, even when she no longer meant to marry him herself. she raised dudley to the peerage as earl of leicester in . in , he finally married lettice knollys, to whom the queen reacted with repeated scenes of displeasure and lifelong hatred. still, dudley always remained at the centre of elizabeths emotional life, as historian susan doran has described the situation. he died shortly after the defeat of the spanish armada in . after elizabeths own death, a note from him was found among her most personal belongings, marked his last letter in her handwriting.

marriage negotiations constituted a key element in elizabeths foreign policy. she turned down the hand of philip, her halfsisters widower, early in  but for several years entertained the proposal of king eric xiv of sweden. earlier in elizabeths life a danish match for her had been discussed; henry viii had proposed one with the danish prince adolf, duke of holsteingottorp, in , and edward seymour, duke of somerset, suggested a marriage with prince frederick  several years later, but the negotiations had abated in . in the years around  a danoenglish protestant alliance was considered, and to counter swedens proposal, king frederick ii proposed to elizabeth in late .

for several years she also seriously negotiated to marry philips cousin charles ii, archduke of austria. by , relations with the habsburgs had deteriorated. elizabeth considered marriage to two french valois princes in turn, first henry, duke of anjou, and then from  to  his brother francis, duke of anjou, formerly duke of alençon. this last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against spanish control of the southern netherlands. elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frogshaped earring that francis had sent her.in , elizabeth told an imperial envoy if i follow the inclination of my nature, it is this beggarwoman and single, far rather than queen and married. later in the year, following elizabeths illness with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue in parliament. members urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, to prevent a civil war upon her death. she refused to do either. in april she prorogued the parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in .

having previously promised to marry, she told an unruly house

i will never break the word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honours sake. and therefore i say again, i will marry as soon as i can conveniently, if god take not him away with whom i mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let obstruction happen.

by , senior figures in the government privately accepted that elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. william cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. for her failure to marry, elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. her silence, however, strengthened her own political security she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she remembered the way that a second person, as i have been had been used as the focus of plots against her predecessor.

elizabeths unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the virgin mary. in poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman. at first, only elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity in , she told the commons, and, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin. later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an iconography that exalted elizabeth. public tributes to the virgin by  acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queens marriage negotiations with the duke of alençon. ultimately, elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. in , she spoke of all my husbands, my good people.

this claim of virginity was not universally accepted. catholics accused elizabeth of engaging in filthy lust that symbolically defiled the nation along with her body. henry iv of france said that one of the great questions of europe was whether queen elizabeth was a maid or no.a central issue, when it comes to the question of elizabeths virginity, was whether the queen ever consummated her love affair with robert dudley. in , she had dudleys bedchambers moved next to her own apartments. in , she was mysteriously bedridden with an illness that caused her body to swell.in , a young man calling himself arthur dudley was arrested on the coast of spain under suspicion of being a spy. the man claimed to be the illegitimate son of elizabeth and robert dudley, with his age being consistent with birth during the  illness. he was taken to madrid for investigation, where he was examined by francis englefield, a catholic aristocrat exiled to spain and secretary to king philip ii. three letters exist today describing the interview, detailing what arthur proclaimed to be the story of his life, from birth in the royal palace to the time of his arrival in spain. however, this failed to convince the spanish englefield admitted to king philip that arthurs claim at present amounts to nothing, but suggested that he should not be allowed to get away, but ... kept very secure. the king agreed, and arthur was never heard from again. modern scholarship dismisses the storys basic premise as impossible, and asserts that elizabeths life was so closely observed by contemporaries that she could not have hidden a pregnancy.

elizabeths first policy toward scotland was to oppose the french presence there. she feared that the french planned to invade england and put her catholic cousin mary, queen of scots, on the throne. mary was considered by many to be the heir to the english crown, being the granddaughter of henry viiis elder sister, margaret. mary boasted being the nearest kinswoman she hath. elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into scotland to aid the protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting treaty of edinburgh of july  removed the french threat in the north. when mary returned to scotland in  to take up the reins of power, the country had an established protestant church and was run by a council of protestant nobles supported by elizabeth. mary refused to ratify the treaty.in , elizabeth proposed her own suitor, robert dudley, as a husband for mary, without asking either of the two people concerned. both proved unenthusiastic, and in , mary married henry stuart, lord darnley, who carried his own claim to the english throne. the marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by mary that handed the victory to the scottish protestants and to elizabeth. darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in february  by conspirators almost certainly led by james hepburn, th earl of bothwell. shortly afterwards, on  may , mary married bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. elizabeth confronted mary about the marriage, writing to her

how could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.

these events led rapidly to marys defeat and imprisonment in lochleven castle. the scottish lords forced her to abdicate in favour of her son james vi, who had been born in june . james was taken to stirling castle to be raised as a protestant. mary escaped in  but after a defeat at langside sailed to england, where she had once been assured of support from elizabeth. elizabeths first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch, but she and her council instead chose to play safe. rather than risk returning mary to scotland with an english army or sending her to france and the catholic enemies of england, they detained her in england, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.

mary was soon the focus for rebellion. in  there was a major catholic rising in the north; the goal was to free mary, marry her to thomas howard, th duke of norfolk, and put her on the english throne. after the rebels defeat, over  of them were executed on elizabeths orders. in the belief that the revolt had been successful, pope pius v issued a bull in , titled regnans in excelsis, which declared elizabeth, the pretended queen of england and the servant of crime to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication. the papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against catholics by parliament, which were, however, mitigated by elizabeths intervention. in , to convert english subjects to catholicism with the intent to withdraw them from their allegiance to elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. from the s missionary priests from continental seminaries went to england secretly in the cause of the reconversion of england. many suffered execution, engendering a cult of martyrdom.regnans in excelsis gave english catholics a strong incentive to look to mary as the legitimate sovereign of england. mary may not have been told of every catholic plot to put her on the english throne, but from the ridolfi plot of   to the babington plot of , elizabeths spymaster francis walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. at first, elizabeth resisted calls for marys death. by late , she had been persuaded to sanction marys trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the babington plot. elizabeths proclamation of the sentence announced that the said mary, pretending title to the same crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm diverse things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person. on  february , mary was beheaded at fotheringhay castle, northamptonshire. after the execution, elizabeth claimed that she had not intended for the signed execution warrant to be dispatched, and blamed her secretary, william davison, for implementing it without her knowledge. the sincerity of elizabeths remorse and whether or not she wanted to delay the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.

elizabeths foreign policy was largely defensive. the exception was the english occupation of le havre from october  to june , which ended in failure when elizabeths huguenot allies joined with the catholics to retake the port. elizabeths intention had been to exchange le havre for calais, lost to france in january . only through the activities of her fleets did elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. this paid off in the war against spain,  of which was fought at sea. she knighted francis drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from  to , and he won fame for his raids on spanish ports and fleets. an element of piracy and selfenrichment drove elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.

after the occupation and loss of le havre in , elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until , when she sent an english army to aid the protestant dutch rebels against philip ii. this followed the deaths in  of the queens allies william the silent, prince of orange, and the duke of anjou, and the surrender of a series of dutch towns to alexander farnese, duke of parma, philips governor of the spanish netherlands. in december , an alliance between philip ii and the french catholic league at joinville undermined the ability of anjous brother, henry iii of france, to counter spanish domination of the netherlands. it also extended spanish influence along the channel coast of france, where the catholic league was strong, and exposed england to invasion. the siege of antwerp in the summer of  by the duke of parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the english and the dutch. the outcome was the treaty of nonsuch of august , in which elizabeth promised military support to the dutch. the treaty marked the beginning of the anglospanish war, which lasted until the treaty of london in .

the expedition was led by elizabeths former suitor, the earl of leicester. elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. her strategy, to support the dutch on the surface with an english army, while beginning secret peace talks with spain within days of leicesters arrival in holland, had necessarily to be at odds with leicesters, who had set up a protectorate and was expected by the dutch to fight an active campaign. elizabeth, on the other hand, wanted him to avoid at all costs any decisive action with the enemy. he enraged elizabeth by accepting the post of governorgeneral from the dutch states general. elizabeth saw this as a dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the netherlands, which so far she had always declined. she wrote to leicester

we could never have imagined  that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour ... and therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.

elizabeths commandment was that her emissary read out her letters of disapproval publicly before the dutch council of state, leicester having to stand nearby. this public humiliation of her lieutenantgeneral combined with her continued talks for a separate peace with spain irreversibly undermined leicesters standing among the dutch. the military campaign was severely hampered by elizabeths repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, leicesters own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the factionridden and chaotic situation of dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign. leicester finally resigned his command in december .

meanwhile, francis drake had undertaken a major voyage against spanish ports and ships in the caribbean in  and . in  he made a successful raid on cádiz, destroying the spanish fleet of war ships intended for the enterprise of england, as philip ii had decided to take the war to england.on  july , the spanish armada, a great fleet of ships, set sail for the channel, planning to ferry a spanish invasion force under the duke of parma to the coast of southeast england from the netherlands. the armada was defeated by a combination of miscalculation, misfortune, and an attack of english fire ships off gravelines at midnight on  july , which dispersed the spanish ships to the northeast. the armada straggled home to spain in shattered remnants, after disastrous losses on the coast of ireland . unaware of the armadas fate, english militias mustered to defend the country under the earl of leicesters command. leicester invited elizabeth to inspect her troops at tilbury in essex on  august. wearing a silver breastplate over a white velvet dress, she addressed them in one of her most famous speeches

my loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but i assure you, i do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people ... i know i have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but i have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of england too, and think foul scorn that parma or spain, or any prince of europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.

when no invasion came, the nation rejoiced. elizabeths procession to a thanksgiving service at st pauls cathedral rivalled that of her coronation as a spectacle. the defeat of the armada was a potent propaganda victory, both for elizabeth and for protestant england. the english took their delivery as a symbol of gods favour and of the nations inviolability under a virgin queen. however, the victory was not a turning point in the war, which continued and often favoured spain. the spanish still controlled the southern provinces of the netherlands, and the threat of invasion remained. walter raleigh claimed after her death that elizabeths caution had impeded the war against spain

if the late queen would have believed her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times. but her majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.

though some historians have criticised elizabeth on similar grounds, raleighs verdict has more often been judged unfair. elizabeth had good reason not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, as she put it herself, to be transported with an haviour of vainglory.in , the year after the spanish armada, elizabeth sent to spain the english armada or counter armada with , men and  ships, led by francis drake as admiral and john norreys as general. the english fleet suffered a catastrophic defeat with ,, killed, wounded or died of disease and  ships sunk or captured. the advantage england had won upon the destruction of the spanish armada was lost, and the spanish victory marked a revival of philip iis naval power through the next decade.

when the protestant henry iv inherited the french throne in , elizabeth sent him military support. it was her first venture into france since the retreat from le havre in . henrys succession was strongly contested by the catholic league and by philip ii, and elizabeth feared a spanish takeover of the channel ports.

the subsequent english campaigns in france, however, were disorganised and ineffective. peregrine bertie, largely ignoring elizabeths orders, roamed northern france to little effect, with an army of , men. he withdrew in disarray in december , having lost half his troops. in , the campaign of john norreys, who led , men to brittany, was even more of a disaster. as for all such expeditions, elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. norreys left for london to plead in person for more support. in his absence, a catholic league army almost destroyed the remains of his army at craon, northwest france, in may .

in july, elizabeth sent out another force under robert devereux, nd earl of essex, to help henry iv in besieging rouen. the result was just as dismal. essex accomplished nothing and returned home in january . henry abandoned the siege in april. as usual, elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do, she wrote of essex, we are ignorant.

although ireland was one of her two kingdoms, elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, irish population that adhered to catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving spain a base from which to attack england. in the course of a series of uprisings, crown forces pursued scorchedearth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. during a revolt in munster led by gerald fitzgerald, in , an estimated , irish people starved to death. the poet and colonist edmund spenser wrote that the victims were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same. elizabeth advised her commanders that the irish, that rude and barbarous nation, be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose.between  and , elizabeth faced her most severe test in ireland during the nine years war, a revolt that took place at the height of hostilities with spain, who backed the rebel leader, hugh oneill. in spring , elizabeth sent robert devereux, to put the revolt down. to her frustration, he made little progress and returned to england in defiance of her orders. he was replaced by charles blount, who took three years to defeat the rebels. oneill finally surrendered in , a few days after elizabeths death. soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between england and spain.

elizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the tsardom of russia that were originally established by her halfbrother, edward vi. she often wrote to tsar ivan the terrible on amicable terms, though the tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance. ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in england should his rule be jeopardised. english merchant and explorer anthony jenkinson, who began his career as a representative of the muscovy company, became the queens special ambassador to the court of tsar ivan.upon his death in , ivan was succeeded by his son feodor i. unlike his father, feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with england. he declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the english ambassador jerome bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by ivan. elizabeth sent a new ambassador, dr. giles fletcher, to demand from the regent boris godunov that he convince the tsar to reconsider. the negotiations failed, due to fletcher addressing feodor with two of his many titles omitted. elizabeth continued to appeal to feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. she proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by feodors father, but was turned down.

trade and diplomatic relations developed between england and the barbary states during the rule of elizabeth. england established a trading relationship with morocco in opposition to spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for moroccan sugar, in spite of a papal ban. in , abd elouahed ben messaoud, the principal secretary to the moroccan ruler mulai ahmad almansur, visited england as an ambassador to the english court, to negotiate an anglomoroccan alliance against spain. elizabeth agreed to sell munitions supplies to morocco, and she and mulai ahmad almansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the spanish. discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.diplomatic relations were also established with the ottoman empire with the chartering of the levant company and the dispatch of the first english ambassador to the sublime porte, william harborne, in . for the first time, a treaty of commerce was signed in . numerous envoys were dispatched in both directions and epistolar exchanges occurred between elizabeth and sultan murad iii. in one correspondence, murad entertained the notion that protestantism and islam had much more in common than either did with roman catholicism, as both rejected the worship of idols, and argued for an alliance between england and the ottoman empire. to the dismay of catholic europe, england exported tin and lead  and ammunitions to the ottoman empire, and elizabeth seriously discussed joint military operations with murad iii during the outbreak of war with spain in , as francis walsingham was lobbying for a direct ottoman military involvement against the common spanish enemy.

in , humphrey gilbert sailed west to establish a colony in newfoundland. he never returned to england. gilberts halfbrother walter raleigh explored the atlantic coast and claimed the territory of virginia, perhaps named in honour of elizabeth, the virgin queen. this territory was much larger than the presentday state of virginia, extending from new england to the carolinas. in , raleigh returned to virginia with a small group of people. they landed on roanoke island, off presentday north carolina. after the failure of the first colony, raleigh recruited another group and put john white in command. when raleigh returned in , there was no trace of the roanoke colony he had left, but it was the first english settlement in north america.

the east india company was formed to trade in the indian ocean region and china, and received its charter from queen elizabeth on  december . for a period of  years, the company was awarded a monopoly on english trade with all countries east of the cape of good hope and west of the straits of magellan. james lancaster commanded the first expedition in . the company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in india in the th and th centuries.

the period after the defeat of the spanish armada in  brought new difficulties for elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. the conflicts with spain and in ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. prices rose and the standard of living fell. during this time, repression of catholics intensified, and elizabeth authorised commissions in  to interrogate and monitor catholic householders. to maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. in her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the publics affection for her.

one of the causes for this second reign of elizabeth, as it is sometimes called, was the changed character of elizabeths governing body, the privy council in the s. a new generation was in power. with the exception of william cecil, baron burghley, the most important politicians had died around  the earl of leicester in ; francis walsingham in ; and christopher hatton in . factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the s, now became its hallmark. a bitter rivalry arose between robert devereux, the earl of essex, and robert cecil, son of lord burghley, with both being supported by their respective adherents. the struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred the kingdoms politics. the queens personal authority was lessening, as is shown in the  affair of dr. lopez, her trusted physician. when he was wrongly accused by the earl of essex of treason out of personal pique, she could not prevent the doctors execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.during the last years of her reign, elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a costfree system of patronage, rather than asking parliament for more subsidies in a time of war. the practice soon led to pricefixing, the enrichment of courtiers at the publics expense, and widespread resentment. this culminated in agitation in the house of commons during the parliament of . in her famous golden speech of  november  at whitehall palace to a deputation of  members, elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions

who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. and as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us

this same period of economic and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in england. the first signs of a new literary movement had appeared at the end of the second decade of elizabeths reign, with john lylys euphues and edmund spensers the shepheardes calender in . during the s, some of the great names of english literature entered their maturity, including william shakespeare and christopher marlowe. continuing into the jacobean era, the english theatre would reach its peak. the notion of a great elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during elizabeths reign. they owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.as elizabeth aged, her image gradually changed. she was portrayed as belphoebe or astraea, and after the armada, as gloriana, the eternally youthful faerie queene of edmund spensers poem. elizabeth gave edmund spenser a pension; as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work. her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. in fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in , leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. andré hurault de maisse, ambassador extraordinary from henry iv of france, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, her teeth are very yellow and unequal ... and on the left side less than on the right. many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly. yet he added, her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal. walter raleigh called her a lady whom time had surprised.

the more elizabeths beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it. elizabeth was happy to play the part, but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. she became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young earl of essex, who was leicesters stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. she repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. after essexs desertion of his command in ireland in , elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. in february , essex tried to raise a rebellion in london. he intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on  february. elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. an observer wrote in  her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail essex.

elizabeths senior adviser, lord burghley, died on  august . his political mantle passed to his son robert, who soon became the leader of the government. one task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. since elizabeth would never name her successor, robert cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. he therefore entered into a coded negotiation with james vi of scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. cecil coached the impatient james to humour elizabeth and secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions. the advice worked. jamess tone delighted elizabeth, who responded so trust i that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort. in historian j. e. neales view, elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to james, but she made them known with unmistakable if veiled phrases.

the queens health remained fair until the autumn of , when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. in february , the death of catherine carey, countess of nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend lady knollys, came as a particular blow. in march, elizabeth fell sick and remained in a settled and unremovable melancholy, and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. when robert cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped must is not a word to use to princes, little man. she died on  march  at richmond palace, between two and three in the morning. a few hours later, cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed james king of england.while it has become normative to record elizabeths death as occurring in , following english calendar reform in the s, at the time england observed new years day on  march, commonly known as lady day. thus elizabeth died on the last day of the year  in the old calendar. the modern convention is to use the old style calendar for the day and month while using the new style calendar for the year.

elizabeths coffin was carried downriver at night to whitehall, on a barge lit with torches. at her funeral on  april, the coffin was taken to westminster abbey on a hearse drawn by four horses hung with black velvet. in the words of the chronicler john stow

westminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.

elizabeth was interred in westminster abbey, in a tomb shared with her halfsister, mary i. the latin inscription on their tomb, regno consortes  urna, hic obdormimus elizabetha et maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis, translates to consorts in realm and tomb, here we sleep, elizabeth and mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection.

elizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death. expectations of king james started high but then declined. by the s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of elizabeth. elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. james was depicted as a catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. the triumphalist image that elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. godfrey goodman, bishop of gloucester, recalled when we had experience of a scottish government, the queen did seem to revive. then was her memory much magnified. elizabeths reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.the picture of elizabeth painted by her protestant admirers of the early th century has proved lasting and influential. her memory was also revived during the napoleonic wars, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion. in the victorian era, the elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day, and in the midth century, elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. historians of that period, such as j. e. neale  and a. l. rowse , interpreted elizabeths reign as a golden age of progress. neale and rowse also idealised the queen personally she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.recent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of elizabeth. her reign is famous for the defeat of the armada, and for successful raids against the spanish, such as those on cádiz in  and , but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. in ireland, elizabeths forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. rather than as a brave defender of the protestant nations against spain and the habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. she offered very limited aid to foreign protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.elizabeth established an english church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today. those who praised her later as a protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of catholic origin from the church of england. historians note that in her day, strict protestants regarded the acts of settlement and uniformity of  as a compromise. in fact, elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as francis bacon put it, to make windows into mens hearts and secret thoughts.though elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised englands status abroad. she is only a woman, only mistress of half an island, marvelled pope sixtus v, and yet she makes herself feared by spain, by france, by the empire, by all. under elizabeth, the nation gained a new selfconfidence and sense of sovereignty, as christendom fragmented. elizabeth was the first tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. she therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust to tell her the trutha style of government that her stuart successors failed to follow. some historians have called her lucky; she believed that god was protecting her. priding herself on being mere english, elizabeth trusted in god, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. in a prayer, she offered thanks to god that

at a time when wars and seditions with grievous persecutions have vexed almost all kings and countries round about me, my reign hath been peacable, and my realm a receptacle to thy afflicted church. the love of my people hath appeared firm, and the devices of my enemies frustrate.

the president of the united states is the head of state and head of government of the united states, indirectly elected to a fouryear term via the electoral college. the officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commanderinchief of the united states armed forces. since the office was established in ,  men have served in  presidencies. the first president, george washington, won a unanimous vote of the electoral college. grover cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms and is therefore counted as the nd and th president of the united states, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of persons who have served as president. the incumbent president is joe biden.the presidency of william henry harrison, who died  days after taking office in , was the shortest in american history. franklin d. roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in . he is the only u.s. president to have served more than two terms. since the ratification of the twentysecond amendment to the united states constitution in , no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.four presidents died in office of natural causes , four were assassinated , and one resigned . john tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.throughout most of its history, american politics has been dominated by political parties. the constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in , no organized parties existed. soon after the st congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant washington administration officials, such as alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson. concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eightyear presidency. he was, and remains, the only u.s. president never affiliated with a political party.

stephen mark hawkins oam  is an australian former national champion, world champion and olympic gold medal winning lightweight rower.

hawkins senior rowing was from the lindisfarne rowing club near hobart. he commenced contesting the national lightweight single sculls title at the australian rowing championships in , coached by his father stephen hawkins snr. in  he beat out his tasmanian rival simon burgess and claimed his first national lightweight championship in the single sculls. he won that same title at australian rowing championships in  and . in  he placed second behind peter antonie in the heavyweight single sculls australian championship.from  to  he was the tasmanian state representative picked to race the presidents cup  the open heavyweight single scull  at the interstate regatta within the australian rowing championships. he won the interstate championship for tasmania in .

hawkins first competed at a fisa event at the  world rowing championships in his home state of tasmania  in a lightweight quad scull with burgess, gary lynagh and bruce hick. they won the bronze medal. the following year at vienna  that same crew  won gold and a world championship title. they rowed through the field and won by . seconds.in  hawkins was selected in the olympic heavyweight double scull with peter antonie to compete at barcelona . antonie, a veteran of  years of international competition was, like hawkins a lightweight and they were respectively australias  and  ranked scullers ahead of the heavyweights richard powell and jason day. the selectors felt that antonie would be unlikely to win the single scull event but using a weight corrected ergo score methodology determined that antonie and hawkins together could be competitive in the double. they prepared perfectly, raced superbly and won the olympic gold.for roudnice  and indianapolis  hawkins was selected as australias lightweight single sculler. he rowed to second place and a silver medal in  behind great britains peter haining. in  he finished in twelfth place.hawkins was inducted into the tasmanian sporting hall of fame in .

the chernobyl disaster began on  april  with the explosion of the no.  reactor of the chernobyl nuclear power plant, near the city of pripyat in the north of the ukrainian ssr, close to the border with the byelorussian ssr, in the soviet union. it is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seventhe maximum severityon the international nuclear event scale, the other being the  fukushima nuclear disaster in japan. the initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than , personnel and cost an estimated  billion roublesroughly us billion in , adjusted for inflation. it is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.the accident occurred during a test of the steam turbines ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture. following an accidental drop in reactor power to nearzero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration. upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance. due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant. this process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building. this was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until  may , during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the ussr and europe. in response to the initial accident, a kilometre  radius exclusion zone was created  hours after the accident, from which approximately , people were evacuated, primarily from pripyat. the exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of  kilometres , from which an additional , people were evacuated.following the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which  workers were hospitalized, of which  exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome . among those hospitalized,  died within the following three months. in the following  years,  more workers  died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure.  childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of . a united nations committee found that to date fewer than  deaths have resulted from the fallout. model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades vary. the most widely cited study conducted by the world health organization in  predicted , cancerrelated fatalities in ukraine, belarus and russia.following the disaster, pripyat was abandoned and eventually replaced by the new purposebuilt city of slavutych. the chernobyl nuclear power plant sarcophagus was built by december . it reduced the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protected it from weathering. the confinement shelter also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which were restarted in late  and . however, this containment structure was only intended to last for  years, and required considerable reinforcement in the early s. the shelter was heavily supplemented in  by the chernobyl new safe confinement, which was constructed around the old structure. this larger enclosure aims to enable the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris while containing the radioactive materials inside. cleanup is scheduled for completion by .

in powergenerating operation, most of the heat generated in a nuclear reactor by its fuel rods is derived from nuclear fission, but a significant fraction  is derived from the radioactive decay of the accumulated fission products, a process known as decay heat. this decay heat continues for some time after the fission chain reaction has been stopped, such as following a reactor shutdown, either emergency or planned, and continued pumped circulation of coolant is essential to prevent core overheating, or in the worst case, core meltdown. rbmk reactors, like those at chernobyl, use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically driven pumps. the coolant flow rate is considerable  reactor no.  had  individual fuel channels, each requiring a coolant flow of  m/h  at full reactor power, for a total of over  million litres per hour  for the entire reactor.

in case of a total power loss at the station, each of chernobyls reactors had three backup diesel generators, but they took  seconds to attain full load and generate the .megawatt output required to run one main pump. in the interim, special counterweights on each pump would enable them to provide coolant via inertia, thereby bridging the gap to generator startup. however, a potential safety risk existed in the event that a station blackout occurred simultaneously with the rupture of a millimetre  coolant pipe . in this scenario the emergency core cooling system  needed to pump additional water into the core, replacing coolant lost to evaporation.it had been theorized that the rotational momentum of the reactors steam turbine could be used to generate the required electrical power to operate the eccs via the feedwater pumps. the turbines speed would run down as energy was taken from it, but analysis indicated that there might be sufficient energy to provide electrical power to run the coolant pumps for  seconds. this would not quite bridge the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators, but would alleviate the situation.

the turbine rundown energy capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully. an initial test carried out in  indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbinegenerator was insufficient; it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip. the electrical system was modified, and the test was repeated in  but again proved unsuccessful. in , the test was conducted a third time but also yielded no results due to a problem with the recording equipment. the test procedure was to be run again in  and was scheduled to take place during a controlled powerdown of reactor no. , which was preparatory to a planned maintenance outage.a test procedure had been written, but the authors were not aware of the unusual rbmk reactor behaviour under the planned operating conditions. it was regarded as purely an electrical test of the generator, not a complex unit test, even though it involved critical unit systems. according to the regulations in place at the time, such a test did not require approval by either the chief design authority for the reactor  or the soviet nuclear safety regulator. the test program called for disabling the emergency core cooling system, a passive/active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a lossofcoolant accident, and approval from the chernobyl site chief engineer had been obtained according to regulations.the test procedure was intended to run as follows

test preparation

the test would take place prior to a scheduled reactor shutdown

the reactor thermal power was to be reduced to between  mw and , mw 

the steamturbine generator was to be run at normal operating speed

four out of eight main circulating pumps were to be supplied with offsite power, while the other four would be powered by the turbineelectrical test

when the correct conditions were achieved, the steam supply to the turbine generator would be closed off, and the reactor would be shut down

the voltage provided by the coasting turbine would be measured, along with the voltage and rpms of the four main circulating pumps being powered by the turbine

when the emergency generators supplied full electrical power, the turbine generator would be allowed to continue freewheeling down

the test was to be conducted during the dayshift of  april  as part of a scheduled reactor shut down. the day shift crew had been instructed in advance on the reactor operating conditions to run the test, and, in addition, a special team of electrical engineers was present to conduct the oneminute test of the new voltage regulating system once the correct conditions had been reached. as planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit began at  on  april, and the power level had reached  of its nominal , mw thermal level by the beginning of the day shift.the day shift performed many unrelated maintenance tasks, and was scheduled to perform the test at . preparations for the test were carried out, including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system. meanwhile, another regional power station unexpectedly went offline. at , the kiev electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of chernobyls output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand, so the test was postponed.

soon, the day shift was replaced by the evening shift. despite the delay, the emergency core cooling system was left disabled. this system had to be disconnected via a manual isolating slide valve, which in practice meant that two or three people spent the whole shift manually turning sailboathelmsized valve wheels. the system would have no influence on the events that unfolded next, but allowing the reactor to run for  hours outside of the test without emergency protection was indicative of a general lack of safety culture.,at , the kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume. this delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift would not take over until midnight, well into the job. according to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shutdown plant.the night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment. anatoly dyatlov, deputy chiefengineer of the chernobyl nuclear power plant, was present to supervise and direct the test. he was one of the tests chief authors and he was the highestranking individual present. unit shift supervisor aleksandr akimov was in charge of the unit  night shift, and leonid toptunov was the senior reactor control engineer responsible for the reactors operational regimen, including the movement of the control rods. yearold toptunov had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months.

the test plan called for a gradual decrease in reactor power to a thermal level of  mw, and an output of  mw was reached at  on  april. however, due to the reactors production of a fission byproduct, xenon, which is a reactioninhibiting neutron absorber, power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action, a process known as reactor poisoning. in steadystate operation, this is avoided because xenon is burned off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by the absorption of neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction, becoming highly stable xenon. with the reactor power reduced, high quantities of previously produced iodine were decaying into the neutronabsorbing xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off. xenon poisoning in this context made reactor control more difficult, but was a predictable and wellunderstood phenomenon during such a power reduction.

when the reactor power had decreased to approximately  mw, the reactor power control was switched from lar  to the automatic regulators, in order to manually maintain the required power level. ar then activated, removing all four of ars control rods automatically, but ar failed to activate due to an imbalance in its ionization chambers. in response, toptunov reduced power to stabilize the automatic regulators ionization sensors. the result was a sudden power drop to an unintended nearshutdown state, with a power output of  mw thermal or less. the exact circumstances that caused the power drop are unknown. most reports attribute the power drop to toptunovs error, but dyatlov reported that it was due to a fault in the ar system.the reactor was now producing only  of the minimum initial power level prescribed for the test. this low reactivity inhibited the burnoff of xenon within the reactor core and hindered the rise of reactor power. to increase power, controlroom personnel removed numerous control rods from the reactor. several minutes elapsed before the reactor was restored to  mw at , at which point most control rods were at their upper limits, but the rod configuration was still within its normal operating limit, with operational reactivity margin  equivalent to having more than  rods inserted. over the next twenty minutes, reactor power would be increased further to  mw.the operation of the reactor at the low power level  was accompanied by unstable core temperatures and coolant flow, and, possibly, by instability of neutron flux. the control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the low levels in one half of the steam/water separator drums, with accompanying drum separator pressure warnings. in response, personnel triggered several rapid influxes of feedwater. relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser.

when a power level of  mw was reattained, preparation for the experiment continued, although the power level was much lower than the prescribed  mw. as part of the test program, two additional main circulating  pumps were activated at . the increased coolant flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core. because water absorbs neutrons better than steam, the neutron flux and reactivity decreased. the operators responded by removing more manual control rods to maintain power. it was around this time that the number of control rods inserted in the reactor fell below the required value of . this was not apparent to the operators, because the rbmk did not have any instruments capable of calculating the inserted rod worth in real time.

the combined effect of these various actions was an extremely unstable reactor configuration. nearly all of the  control rods had been extracted manually, and excessively high coolant flow rates through the core meant that the coolant was entering the reactor very close to the boiling point. unlike other lightwater reactor designs, the rbmk design at that time had a positive void coefficient of reactivity at low power levels. this meant that the formation of steam bubbles  from boiling cooling water intensified the nuclear chain reaction owing to voids having lower neutron absorption than water. unbeknownst to the operators, the void coefficient was not counterbalanced by other reactivity effects in the given operating regime, meaning that any increase in boiling would produce more steam voids which further intensified the chain reaction, leading to a positive feedback loop. given this characteristic, reactor no.  was now at risk of a runaway increase in its core power with nothing to restrain it. the reactor was now very sensitive to the regenerative effect of steam voids on reactor power.,

at , the test began. four of the eight main circulating pumps  were to be powered by voltage from the coasting turbine, while the remaining four pumps received electrical power from the grid as normal. the steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a rundown of the turbine generator. the diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the mcps power needs by . as the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. the water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes.

at , as recorded by the skala centralized control system, a scram  of the reactor was initiated as the experiment was wrapping up. the scram was started when the az button  of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier.

the personnel had already intended to shut down using the az button in preparation for scheduled maintenance and the scram likely preceded the sharp increase in power. however, the precise reason why the button was pressed when it was is not certain, as only the deceased akimov and toptunov partook in that decision, though the atmosphere in the control room was calm at that moment. meanwhile, the rbmk designers claim that the button had to have been pressed only after the reactor already began to selfdestruct.

when the az button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. the control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at . metres per second , so that the rods took  to  seconds to travel the full height of the core, about  metres . a bigger problem was the design of the rbmk control rods, each of which had a graphite neutron moderator section attached to its end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor. that is, when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutronmoderating graphite extension was centered in the core with . metres  columns of water above and below it.consequently, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor in a scram initially displaced neutronabsorbing water in the lower portion of the reactor with neutronmoderating graphite. thus, an emergency scram could initially increase the reaction rate in the lower part of the core. this behaviour was discovered when the initial insertion of control rods in another rbmk reactor at ignalina nuclear power plant in  induced a power spike. procedural countermeasures were not implemented in response to ignalina. the iaea investigative report insag later stated, apparently, there was a widespread view that the conditions under which the positive scram effect would be important would never occur. however, they did appear in almost every detail in the course of the actions leading to the chernobyl accident.a few seconds into the scram, a power spike did occur, and the core overheated, causing some of the fuel rods to fracture. some have speculated that this also blocked the control rod columns, jamming them at onethird insertion. within three seconds the reactor output rose above  mw.instruments did not register the subsequent course of events; it was reconstructed through mathematical simulation. per the simulation, the power spike would have caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. this caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located.

as the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around , mw thermal,  times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the power meter on the control panel. some estimate the power spike may have gone  times higher than that. it was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion, like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. there is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactors exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate called the upper biological shield, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. this is believed to be the first explosion that many heard.this explosion ruptured further fuel channels, as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber, and as a result, the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core. the total water loss combined with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactors thermal power.a second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first; this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction. this explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator. the ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air, significantly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas. the explosion is estimated to have had the power equivalent of  tons of tnt.according to observers outside unit , burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. about  of the redhot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. as a result of the damage to the building, an airflow through the core was established by the cores high temperature. the air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.after the larger explosion, several employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. one such survivor, alexander yuvchenko, recounts that once he stepped out and looked up towards the reactor hall, he saw a very beautiful laserlike beam of blue light caused by the ionizedair glow that appeared to be flooding up into infinity.there were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion. one view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of hydrogen, which had been produced either by the overheated steamzirconium reaction or by the reaction of redhot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide. another hypothesis, by konstantin checherov, published in , was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor due to the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core.

contrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor no. , which was still operating. it was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor no. . inside reactor no. , the chief of the night shift, yuri bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer nikolai fomin would not allow this. the operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working. at , bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor, which was confirmed in writing by dyatlov and station shift supervisor rogozhkin.

shortly after the accident, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires. first on the scene was a chernobyl power station firefighter brigade under the command of lieutenant volodymyr pravyk, who died on  may  of acute radiation sickness. they were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire we didnt know it was the reactor. no one had told us. grigorii khmel, the driver of one of the fire engines, later described what happened

we arrived there at  or  minutes to two in the morning ... we saw graphite scattered about. misha asked is that graphite i kicked it away. but one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up. its hot, he said. the pieces of graphite were of different sizes, some big, some small enough to pick them up ... we didnt know much about radiation. even those who worked there had no idea. there was no water left in the trucks. misha filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top. then those boys who died went up to the roofvashchik, kolya and others, and volodya pravik ... they went up the ladder ... and i never saw them again.

anatoli zakharov, a fireman stationed in chernobyl since , offered a different description in  i remember joking to the others, there must be an incredible amount of radiation here. well be lucky if were all still alive in the morning. he also stated, of course we knew if wed followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor. but it was a moral obligationour duty. we were like kamikaze.the immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing reactor no.  to protect no.  and keep its core cooling systems intact. the fires were extinguished by , but many firefighters received high doses of radiation. the fire inside reactor no.  continued to burn until  may ; it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out.it was thought by some that the core fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping more than , tonnes  of sand, lead, clay, and neutronabsorbing boron onto the burning reactor. it is now known that virtually none of these materials reached the core. historians estimate that about  soviet pilots risked dangerous levels of radiation to fly the thousands of flights needed to cover reactor no.  in this attempt to seal off radiation.from eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died , one described his experience of the radiation as tasting like metal, and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face. this is consistent with the description given by louis slotin, a manhattan project physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident.the explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products  into the air. the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion.

the ionizing radiation levels in the worsthit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be . roentgens per second , equivalent to more than , roentgens per hour. a lethal dose is around  roentgens  over five hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute. unfortunately, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to , r/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on. most remaining dosimeters had limits of . r/s and therefore read off scale. thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above . r/s , while the true levels were much higher in some areas.because of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief aleksandr akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. the evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by  were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective. akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor. none of them wore any protective gear. most, including akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks.

the nearby city of pripyat was not immediately evacuated. the townspeople, in the early hours of the morning, at  local time, went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened. however, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting. as the plant was run by authorities in moscow, the government of ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident.valentyna shevchenko, then chairwoman of the presidium of verkhovna rada of the ukrainian ssr, recalls that ukraines acting minister of internal affairs vasyl durdynets phoned her at work at  to report current affairs; only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the chernobyl nuclear power plant, but it was extinguished and everything was fine. when shevchenko asked how are the people, he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about some are celebrating a wedding, others are gardening, and others are fishing in the pripyat river.shevchenko then spoke over the phone to volodymyr shcherbytsky, general secretary of the communist party of ukraine and de facto head of state, who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by boris shcherbina, the deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the ussr.

a commission was established later in the day to investigate the accident. it was headed by valery legasov, first deputy director of the kurchatov institute of atomic energy, and included leading nuclear specialist evgeny velikhov, hydrometeorologist yuri izrael, radiologist leonid ilyin, and others. they flew to boryspil international airport and arrived at the power plant in the evening of  april. by that time two people had already died and  were hospitalized. the delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure. in the early daylight hours of  april, approximately  hours after the initial blast, they ordered the evacuation of pripyat. initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days; later this was made permanent.

by  on  april, buses had arrived in pripyat to start the evacuation. the evacuation began at . a translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows

for the attention of the residents of pripyat the city council informs you that due to the accident at chernobyl power station in the city of pripyat the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating. the communist party, its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this. nevertheless, with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible, the children being top priority, we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of kiev region. for these reasons, starting from  april ,  each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal, supervised by the police and the city officials. it is highly advisable to take your documents, some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food, just in case, with you. the senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in pripyat to maintain these facilities in a good working order. all the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period. comrades, leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights, electrical equipment and water and shut the windows. please keep calm and orderly in the process of this shortterm evacuation.

to expedite the evacuation, residents were told to bring only what was necessary, and that they would remain evacuated for approximately three days. as a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and residents were only allowed to recover certain items after months had passed. by , , people were evacuated to various villages of the kiev region. the next day, talks began for evacuating people from the kilometre  zone. ten days after the accident, the evacuation area was expanded to  kilometres ., the chernobyl nuclear power plant exclusion zone has remained ever since, although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded.

the surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in , longterm evacuees in total agreeing to be moved. the years between  and  saw the near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled persons from the most severely contaminated areas to approximately ,.

evacuation began one and a half days before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the soviet union. in the morning of  april, radiation levels set off alarms at the forsmark nuclear power plant in sweden, over , kilometres  from the chernobyl plant. workers at forsmark reported the case to the swedish radiation safety authority, which determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere. that day, the swedish government contacted the soviet government to inquire about whether there had been a nuclear accident in the soviet union. the soviets initially denied it, and it was only after the swedish government suggested they were about to file an official alert with the international atomic energy agency, that the soviet government admitted that an accident had taken place at chernobyl.at first, the soviets only conceded that a minor accident had occurred, but once they began evacuating more than , people, the full scale of the situation was realized by the global community. at  the evening of  april, a second announcement was read in the tv news programme vremya there has been an accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant. one of the nuclear reactors was damaged. the effects of the accident are being remedied. assistance has been provided for any affected people. an investigative commission has been set up.this was the entire announcement, and the first time the soviet union officially announced a nuclear accident. the telegraph agency of the soviet union  then discussed the three mile island accident and other american nuclear accidents, which serge schmemann of the new york times wrote was an example of the common soviet tactic of whataboutism. the mention of a commission also indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident, and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music, which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy in the ussr.around the same time, abc news released its report about the disaster. shevchenko was the first of the ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on  april. there she spoke with members of medical staff and people, who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes. shevchenko returned home near midnight, stopping at a radiological checkpoint in vilcha, one of the first that were set up soon after the accident.there was a notification from moscow that there was no reason to postpone the  may international workers day celebrations in kiev , but on  april a meeting of the political bureau of the central committee of the cpsu took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration. scientists were reporting that the radiological background level in kiev was normal. at the meeting, which was finished at , it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular three and a half to four hours to under two hours.several buildings in pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant. these included the jupiter factory  and the azure swimming pool, used by the chernobyl liquidators for recreation during the cleanup .

two floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel. the steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water. after the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water.

the smoldering graphite, fuel and other material above, at more than , c , started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining, creating corium, a radioactive semiliquid material comparable to lava. it was feared that if this mixture melted through the floor into the pool of water, the resulting steam production would further contaminate the area or even cause a steam explosion, ejecting more radioactive material from the reactor. it became necessary to drain the pool. these fears ultimately proved unfounded, since corium began dripping harmlessly into the flooded bubbler pools before the water could be removed. the molten fuel hit the water and cooled into a lightbrown ceramic pumice, whose low density allowed the substance to float on the waters surface.unaware of this fact, the government commission directed that the bubbler pools be drained by opening its sluice gates. the valves controlling it, however, were located in a flooded corridor in a subterranean annex adjacent to the reactor building. volunteers in diving suits and respirators , and equipped with dosimeters, entered the kneedeep radioactive water and managed to open the valves. these were the engineers alexei ananenko and valeri bezpalov , accompanied by the shift supervisor boris baranov. all three men were awarded the order for courage by ukrainian president petro poroshenko in may .numerous media reports falsely suggested that all three men died just days after the incident. in fact all three survived and continued to work in the nuclear energy industry. alexy ananenko and valeri bezpalov were still alive as of , while baranov had died of heart failure in  at age . 

once the bubbler pool gates were opened by the three volunteers, fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement. the operation was not completed until  may, after , tonnes  of water were pumped out.

the government commission was concerned that the molten core would burn into the earth and contaminate groundwater below the reactor. to reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. using oil well drilling equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on  may. it was estimated that  tonnes  of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at  c . this idea was quickly scrapped.as an alternative, subway builders and coal miners were deployed to excavate a tunnel below the reactor to make room for a cooling system. the final makeshift design for the cooling system was to incorporate a coiled formation of pipes cooled with water and covered on top with a thin thermally conductive graphite layer. the graphite layer as a natural refractory material would prevent the concrete above from melting. this graphite cooling plate layer was to be encapsulated between two concrete layers, each  metre  thick for stabilisation. this system was designed by leonid bolshov, the director of the institute for nuclear safety and development formed in . bolshovs graphiteconcrete sandwich would be similar in concept to later core catchers that are now part of many nuclear reactor designs.bolshovs graphite cooling plate, alongside the prior nitrogen injection proposal, were not used following the drop in aerial temperatures and indicative reports that the fuel melt had stopped. it was later determined that the fuel had flowed three floors, with a few cubic meters coming to rest at ground level. the precautionary underground channel with its active cooling was therefore deemed redundant, as the fuel was selfcooling. the excavation was then simply filled with concrete to strengthen the foundation below the reactor.

in the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof. while the worst of the radioactive debris had remained inside what was left of the reactor, it was estimated that there was approximately  tons of debris on that roof which had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the sarcophagusa concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being released into the atmosphere. the initial plan was to use robots to clear the debris off the roof. the soviets used approximately  remotecontrolled robots, most of them built in the soviet union itself. many failed due to the difficult terrain, combined with the effect of high radiation fields on their batteries and electronic controls. in , valery legasov, first deputy director of the kurchatov institute of atomic energy in moscow, said we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything. where there was very high radiation, the robot ceased to be a robotthe electronics quit working.consequently, the most highly radioactive materials were shoveled by chernobyl liquidators from the military wearing heavy protective gear . these soldiers could only spend a maximum of  seconds working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. though the soldiers were only supposed to perform the role of the biorobot a maximum of once, some soldiers reported having done this task five or six times. only  of the debris cleared from the roof was performed by robots; the other  was removed by  , men who absorbed, on average, an estimated dose of  rem  of radiation each.

with the extinguishing of the open air reactor fire, the next step was to prevent the spread of contamination. this could be due to wind action which could carry away loose contamination, and by birds which could land within the wreckage and then carry contamination elsewhere. in addition, rainwater could wash contamination away from the reactor area and into the subsurface water table, where it could migrate outside the site area. rainwater falling on the wreckage could also weaken the remaining reactor structure by accelerating corrosion of steelwork. a further challenge was to reduce the large amount of emitted gamma radiation, which was a hazard to the workforce operating the adjacent reactor no. .the solution chosen was to enclose the wrecked reactor by the construction of a huge composite steel and concrete shelter, which became known as the sarcophagus. it had to be erected quickly and within the constraints of high levels of ambient gamma radiation. the design started on  may ,  days after the disaster, and construction was from june to late november. this major construction project was carried out under the very difficult circumstances of high levels of radiation both from the core remnants and the deposited radioactive contamination around it. 

the construction workers had to be protected from radiation, and techniques such as crane drivers working from leadlined control cabins were employed. the construction work included erecting walls around the perimeter, clearing and surface concreting the surrounding ground to remove sources of radiation and to allow access for large construction machinery, constructing a thick radiation shielding wall to protect the workers in reactor no. , fabricating a highrise buttress to strengthen weak parts of the old structure, constructing an overall roof, and provisioning a ventilation extract system to capture any airborne contamination arising within the shelter.

during the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team, as part of an investigation dubbed complex expedition, reentered the reactor to locate and contain nuclear fuel to prevent another explosion. these scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core. rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes. the scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.in december , after six months of investigation, the team discovered with the help of a remote camera that an intensely radioactive mass more than  metres  wide had formed in the basement of unit four. the mass was called the elephants foot for its wrinkled appearance. it was composed of melted sand, concrete, and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor. the concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by nowsolidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite. it was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion.

the official contaminated zones saw a massive cleanup effort lasting seven months. the official reason for such early  decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be repopulated and brought back into cultivation. within fifteen months  of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled. defence forces must have done much of the work. yet this land was of marginal agricultural value. according to historian david marples, the administration had a psychological purpose for the cleanup they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the chernobyl power station.,,although a number of radioactive emergency vehicles were buried in trenches, many of the vehicles used by the liquidators, including the helicopters, still remained, as of , parked in a field in the chernobyl area. scavengers have since removed many functioning, but highly radioactive, parts. liquidators worked under deplorable conditions, poorly informed and with poor protection. many, if not most of them, exceeded radiation safety limits.the urban decontamination liquidators first washed buildings and roads with barda, a sticky polymerizing fluid, designed to entrap radioactive dust.a unique clean up medal was given to the cleanup workers, known as liquidators.

to investigate the causes of the accident the iaea used the international nuclear safety advisory group , which had been created by the iaea in . it produced two significant reports on chernobyl; insag in , and a revised report, insag in . in summary, according to insag, the main cause of the accident was the operators actions, but according to insag, the main cause was the reactors design.

both iaea reports identified an inadequate safety culture  at all managerial and operational levels as a major underlying factor of different aspects of the accident. this was stated to be inherent not only in operations but also during design, engineering, construction, manufacture and regulation.,views of the main causes were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactors designers, power plant personnel, and the soviet and ukrainian governments. this was due to the uncertainty about the actual sequence of events and plant parameters. after insag more information became available, and more powerful computing has allowed better forensic simulations.the insag conclusion of major factors contributory to the accident was

the accident is now seen to have been the result of concurrence of the following major factors specific physical characteristics of the reactor; specific design features of the reactor control elements; and the fact that the reactor was brought to a state not specified by procedures or investigated by an independent safety body. most importantly, the physical characteristics of the reactor made possible its unstable behaviour.

the first official soviet explanation of the accident was given by soviet scientists and engineers to representatives of iaea member states and other international organisations at the first postaccident review meeting, held at the iaea in vienna  august . this explanation effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. the iaea insag report followed shortly afterwards in september , and on the whole also supported this view, based also on the information provided in discussions with the soviet experts at the vienna review meeting. in this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. for instance; during preparation and testing of the turbine generator under rundown conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise.it was stated that at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the emergency core cooling system , lar , and az . personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to expedite the electrical test completion. several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the test.it was held that the designers of the reactor considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures. thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff.on the disconnection of safety systems, valery legasov said in , it was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight.

in this analysis the operators were blamed, but deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. this view was reflected in numerous publications and artistic works on the theme of the chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident, and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications.

the trial took place from  to  july  in a temporary courtroom set up in the house of culture in the city of chernobyl, ukraine. five plant employees ; and yuri a. laushkin  were sentenced to ten, ten, ten, five, three, and two years respectively in labor camps. the families of aleksandr akimov, leonid toptunov and valery perevozchenko had received official letters, but prosecution against the employees had been terminated at their deaths.

anatoly dyatlov was found guilty of criminal mismanagement of potentially explosive enterprises and sentenced to ten years imprisonmentof which he would serve threefor the role that his oversight of the experiment played in the ensuing accident.

in  a commission of the ussr state committee for the supervision of safety in industry and nuclear power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions. based on that, insag published an additional report, insag, which reviewed that part of the insag report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident, and this included the text of the  ussr state commission report translated into english by the iaea as annex i.by the time of this report, the postsoviet ukrainian government had declassified a number of kgb documents from the period between  and  related to the chernobyl plant. it mentioned, for example, previous reports of structural damage caused by negligence during construction of the plant  that were never acted upon. they documented more than  emergency situations in the plant during this period, eight of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel.in the insag report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, being based on incorrect information obtained in august , or were judged less relevant. the insag report also reflected the view of the  ussr state commission account which held that the operators actions in turning off the emergency core cooling system, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. in fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations. soviet authorities had identified a multitude of operator actions as regulation violations in the original  report while no such regulations were in fact in place.the primary design cause of the accident, as determined by insag, was a major deficiency in safety features, in particular the positive scram effect due to the control rods graphite tips that actually initially increased reactivity when control rods entered the core to reduce reactivity. there was also an overly positive void coefficient of the reactor, whereby steamgenerated voids in the fuel cooling channels would increase reactivity because neutron absorption was reduced, resulting in more steam generation, and thereby more voids; a regenerative process.to avoid such conditions, it was necessary for the operators to track the value of the reactor operational reactivity margin  but this value was not readily available to the operators and they were not aware of the safety significance of orm on void and power coefficients.

however, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. yet postaccident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the orm is reflected in the operating procedures and design documentation for the rbmk is extremely contradictory, and furthermore, orm was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident.even in this revised analysis, the human factor remained identified as a major factor in causing the accident; particularly the operating crews deviation from the test programme. most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test. this included operating the reactor at a lower power level than the prescribed  mw before starting the electrical test. the  assertions of soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.insag also said, the poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. the accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the chernobyl plant, but throughout the soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time.

the reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity. the void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the steam voids increase, fewer neutrons are slowed down. faster neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms, so the reactor produces less power .chernobyls rbmk reactor, however, used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons, and the cooling water acted as a neutron absorber. thus, neutrons are moderated by the graphite even if steam bubbles form in the water. furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing the voids means that more moderated neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactors power output. this could create a positive feedback regenerative process  which makes the rbmk design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to sudden energy surges to a dangerous level. not only was this behaviour counterintuitive, this property of the reactor under certain conditions was unknown to the personnel.

there was a significant flaw in the design of the control rods.  the reactor core was  metres  high. the upper half of the rod  metres  was boron carbide, which absorbs neutrons and thereby slows the reaction. the bottom section of each control rod was a . meter graphite displacer, which prevented the channels from filling with water when rods were withdrawn. the flaw lay in the .metre  gap between the bottom of the graphite displacer and the bottom of the reactor, meaning that the lowest portion of control rod channel was filled with water and not graphite. see page . fig .  with this design, when the rods were inserted from the fully retracted position to stop the reaction on the az signal, the graphite displaced neutronabsorbing water, causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed and increasing reactivity.  for the first  to  seconds of rod deployment until the boron was in position, reactor power across the floor of the reactor could increase, rather than decrease. this feature of control rod operation was counterintuitive and not known to the reactor operators.

other deficiencies were noted in the rbmk reactor design, as were its noncompliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety. while insag and insag reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the insag identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident. these contributing factors include

the plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features

inadequate safety analysis was performed

there was insufficient attention to independent safety review

operating procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis

safety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers

the operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant

operators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures

the regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production

there was a general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally

the force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released after the accident led sergei a. pakhomov and yuri v. dubasov in  to theorize that the second explosion could have been an extremely fast nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. pakhomov and dubasov argued that there was no delayed supercritical increase in power but a runaway prompt criticality which would have developed much faster. he felt the physics of this would be more similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon, and it produced the second explosion.their evidence came from cherepovets, a city , kilometres  northeast of chernobyl, where physicists from the v.g. khlopin radium institute measured anomalous high levels of xenona short halflife isotopefour days after the explosion. this meant that a nuclear event in the reactor may have ejected xenon to higher altitudes in the atmosphere than the later fire did, allowing widespread movement of xenon to remote locations. this was an alternative to the more accepted explanation of a positivefeedback power excursion where the reactor disassembled itself by steam explosion.the energy released by the second explosion, which produced the majority of the damage, was estimated by pakhomov and dubasov to be at  billion joules, the equivalent of about  tons of tnt.pakhomov and dubasovs nuclear fizzle hypothesis was examined in  by larserik de geer, christer persson and henning rodhe, who put the hypothesized fizzle event as the more probable cause of the first explosion. both analyses argue that the nuclear fizzle event, whether producing the second or first explosion, consisted of a prompt chain reaction that was limited to a small portion of the reactor core, since selfdisassembly occurs rapidly in fizzle events.de geer, persson and rodhe commented

we believe that thermal neutron mediated nuclear explosions at the bottom of a number of fuel channels in the reactor caused a jet of debris to shoot upwards through the refuelling tubes. this jet then rammed the tubes kg plugs, continued through the roof and travelled into the atmosphere to altitudes of .km where the weather conditions provided a route to cherepovets. the steam explosion which ruptured the reactor vessel occurred some . seconds later.this second explosion was estimated by the authors to have had the power equivalent of  tons of tnt.

although it is difficult to compare releases between the chernobyl accident and a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it has still been estimated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from chernobyl than by the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki together. however, the chernobyl accident only released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the cold war; the wide estimate being due to the different abundances of isotopes released.at chernobyl, approximately , square kilometres  of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in belarus, ukraine and russia. lower levels of contamination were detected over all of europe except for the iberian peninsula. most of the fallout with radioactive dust particles was released during the first ten days after the accident. by around may , a radioactive cloud had reached the netherlands and belgium.

the initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from soviet sources, but from sweden. on the morning of  april, workers at the forsmark nuclear power plant in central sweden  were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes, except they had this whenever they came to work rather than exiting.it was swedens elevated radioactivity level, detected at noon on  april that, having been determined as not caused by a leak at the swedish plant, first suggested a serious nuclear problem originating from the western soviet union. the evacuation of pripyat on  april had been silently completed without the disaster being declared outside the soviet union. a rise in radiation levels in the subsequent days had also been measured in finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication.

contamination from the chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions, much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the alps, the welsh mountains and the scottish highlands, where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall. the resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized, and localized waterflows contributed to large variations in radioactivity over small areas. sweden and norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front, bringing rain., there was also groundwater contamination.

rain was deliberately seeded over , square kilometres  belarus by the soviet air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas. heavy, blackcoloured rain fell on the city of gomel. reports from soviet and western scientists indicate that the belarusian ssr received about  of the contamination that fell on the former soviet union. however, the  torch report stated that up to half of the volatile particles had actually landed outside the former ussr area currently making up of ukraine, belarus, and russia. an unconnected large area in russian sfsr south of bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern ukrainian ssr. studies in surrounding countries indicate that more than one million people could have been affected by radiation. data from a longterm monitoring program  shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in belarus close to gomel. resettlement may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules.

in western europe, precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included banning the importation of certain foods. a  study by the french society for nuclear energy found that contamination was relatively limited, diminishing from west to east, such that a hunter consuming  kilograms of contaminated wild boar in  would be exposed to about one millisievert.

the chernobyl release was characterized by the physical and chemical properties of the radioisotopes in the core. particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium. iodine was and caesium remains the two most responsible for the radiation exposure received by the general population.detailed reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in  and , with the latter report updated in .

at different times after the accident, different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose. the remaining quantity of any radioisotope, and therefore the activity of that isotope, after  decay halflives have passed, is less than  of its initial magnitude, and it continues to reduce beyond . after  halflives to . remaining after  halflives have passed and so on. some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive, which is not accounted for here. the release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points, and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor.

all of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion. the atmospheric release of xenon, with a halflife of  days, is estimated at  pbq.

 to  of all core radioiodine in the reactor, about  pbq , or about . kilograms , was released, as a mixture of sublimed vapour, solid particles, and organic iodine compounds. iodine has a halflife of  days.

 to  of all core caesium was released,  pbq in all. caesium was released in aerosol form; caesium, along with isotopes of strontium, are the two primary elements preventing the chernobyl exclusion zone being reinhabited. . bq equals  kilograms of caesium. cs has a halflife of  years.

tellurium, halflife  hours, an estimated  pbq was released.

an early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was .; this was later revised to ... this corresponds to the atmospheric emission of  tonnes  of fragmented fuel.two sizes of particles were released small particles of . to . micrometres, each an individually unrecognizable small dust or smog sized particulate matter and larger settling dust sized particles that therefore were quicker to fallout of the air, of  micrometres in diameter. these larger particles contained about  to  of the released high boiling point or nonvolatile radioisotopes; zirconium, niobium, lanthanum, cerium and the transuranic elements, including neptunium, plutonium and the minor actinides, embedded in a uranium oxide matrix.

the dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open. the exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope, requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis and whole body count exams, of which , were conducted in ukraine by soviet medical personnel in .

the chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the pripyat river, which feeds into the dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in europe, which at the time supplied water to kievs . million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred. the radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident.in the most affected areas of ukraine, levels of radioactivity  in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident. guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to , bq/l, allowing most water to be reported as safe. officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom in an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for  years.

a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the chernobyl plants cooling pond was within acceptable norms. despite this, two months after the disaster the kiev water supply was switched from the dnieper to the desna river. meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous metre  deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the pripyat river.groundwater was not badly affected by the chernobyl accident since radionuclides with short halflives decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies, and longerlived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater. however, significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the  km  exclusion zone around chernobyl. although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites offsite , the iaea chernobyl report argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of surfacedeposited radioactivity.

 bioaccumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations  that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption. guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately  bq/kg in the european union. in the kiev reservoir in ukraine, concentrations in fish were in the range of  bq/kg during the first few years after the accident.in small closed lakes in belarus and the bryansk region of russia, concentrations in a number of fish species varied from  to , bq/kg during the period . the contamination of fish caused shortterm concern in parts of the uk and germany and in the long term  in the affected areas of ukraine, belarus, and russia as well as in parts of scandinavia.chernobyls radiocaesium deposits were used to calibrate sedimentation samples from lake qattinah, arabic بحيرة قطينة in syria. the cs provides a sharp, maximal, data point in radioactivity of the core sample at the  depth, and acts as a date check on the depth of the pb in the core sample.

after the disaster, four square kilometres  of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddishbrown and died, earning the name of the red forest. some animals in the worsthit areas also died or stopped reproducing. most domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the pripyat river  km  from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of  sv. some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage. the next generation appeared to be normal. the mutation rates for plants and animals have increased by a factor of  because of the release of radionuclides from chernobyl. there is evidence for elevated mortality rates and increased rates of reproductive failure in contaminated areas, consistent with the expected frequency of deaths due to mutations.on farms in narodychi raion of ukraine it is claimed that from  to  nearly  animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs, missing eyes, heads or ribs, or deformed skulls; in comparison, only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior.subsequent research on microorganisms, while limited, suggests that in the aftermath of the disaster, bacterial and viral specimens exposed to the radiation  underwent rapid changes. activations of soil micromycetes have been reported. it is currently unclear how these changes in species with rapid reproductive turnover  will manifest in terms of virulence, drug resistance, immune evasion, and so on; a paper in  reported the discovery of an escherichia coli mutant that was hyperresistant to a variety of dnadamaging elements, including xray radiation, uvc, and nitroquinoline oxide . cladosporium sphaerospermum, a species of fungus that has thrived in the chernobyl contaminated area, has been investigated for the purpose of using the fungus particular melanin to protect against highradiation environments, such as space travel. the disaster has been described by lawyers, academics and journalists as an example of ecocide.

with radiocaesium binding less with humic acid, peaty soils than the known binding fixation that occurs on kaolinite rich clay soils, many marshy areas of ukraine had the highest soil to dairymilk transfer coefficients, of soil activity in   kbq/m to dairy milk activity in bq/l, that had ever been reported, with the transfer, from initial land activity into milk activity, ranging from . to  times that which was on the soil, a variance depending on the natural acidityconditioning of the pasture.in , soviet medical teams conducted some , wholebody count examinations on inhabitants in otherwise comparatively lightly contaminated regions with good prospects for recovery. this was to determine the effect of banning local food and using only food imports on the internal body burden of radionuclides in inhabitants. concurrent agricultural countermeasures were used when cultivation did occur, to further reduce the soil to human transfer as much as possible. the expected highest body activity was in the first few years, where the unabated ingestion of local food, primarily milk consumption, resulted in the transfer of activity from soil to body; after the dissolution of the ussr, the nowreduced scale initiative to monitor the human body activity in these regions of ukraine, recorded a small and gradual halfdecadallong rise, in internal committed dose, before returning to the previous trend of observing ever lower body counts each year.this momentary rise is hypothesized to be due to the cessation of the soviet food imports together with many villagers returning to older dairy food cultivation practices and large increases in wild berry and mushroom foraging, the latter of which have similar peaty soil to fruiting body, radiocaesium transfer coefficients.

in a  paper, a robot sent into the reactor itself returned with samples of black, melaninrich radiotrophic fungi that grow on the reactors walls.of the , wild boar killed in the  hunting season in germany, approximately one thousand were contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of  becquerels of caesium per kilogram, of dry weight, due to residual radioactivity from chernobyl. while all animal meat contains a natural level of potassium at a similar level of activity, with both wild and farm animals in italy containing    becquerels kg dw of that naturally occurring gamma emitter.because elaphomyces fungal species bioaccumulate radiocaesium, boars of the bavarian forest that consume these deer truffles are contaminated at higher levels than their environments soil. given that nuclear weapons release a higher c/c ratio than nuclear reactors, the high c content in these boars suggests that their radiological contamination can be largely attributed to the soviet unions nuclear weapons testing in ukraine, which peaked during the late s and early s.in , longterm empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance.

on high ground, such as mountain ranges, there is increased precipitation due to adiabatic cooling. this resulted in localized concentrations of contaminants on distant areas; higher in bq/m values to many lowland areas much closer to the source of the plume. this effect occurred on high ground in norway and the uk.

the norwegian agricultural authority reported that in  a total of , livestock in norway required uncontaminated feed for a period before slaughter, to ensure that their meat had an activity below the government permitted value of caesium per kilogram deemed suitable for human consumption. this contamination was due to residual radioactivity from chernobyl in the mountain plants they graze on in the wild during the summer. , sheep required uncontaminated feed for a time before slaughter during , with these sheep located in only  of norways municipalities, a decrease from the  municipalities in  and the  municipalities affected during .

the aftereffects of chernobyl on the mountain lamb industry in norway were expected to be seen for a further  years, although the severity of the effects would decline over that period. scientists report this is due to radioactive caesium isotopes being taken up by fungi such as cortinarius caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep while grazing.

the united kingdom restricted the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium fell across parts of northern ireland, wales, scotland, and northern england. in the immediate aftermath of the disaster in , the movement of a total of ,, sheep was restricted across a total of , farms, to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food chain. the number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since . northern ireland was released from all restrictions in , and by ,  farms containing around , sheep remained under the restrictions in wales, cumbria, and northern scotland. the restrictions applying in scotland were lifted in , while those applying to wales and cumbria were lifted during , meaning no farms in the uk remain restricted because of chernobyl fallout.the legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers  was revoked during october and november , by the relevant authorities in the uk. had restrictions in the uk not occurred, a heavy consumer of lamb meat would likely have received a dose of . msv over a lifetime.

the only known, causal deaths from the accident involved workers in the plant and firefighters. the reactor explosion killed two engineers and severely burned two others who were among the  workers hospitalized in the immediate aftermath. of the hospitalized workers,  exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome, including one disputed case.  of the hospitalized workers died within the following three months, all of whom were hospitalized for ars and  were among the  patients hospitalized for burns. among the fatalities in the acute phase , all but one patient  were hospitalized for grade  or  ars. fifteen out of  patients with grade  ars survived. only one patient out of  with grade  ars survived.some sources report a total initial fatality of , which includes one additional death caused by coronary thrombosis attributed to stress or coincidence, but this occurred offsite.there were a number of fishermen on the reservoir a halfkilometer from the reactor to the east. of these, two shore fishermen, protosov and pustavoit, are said to have sustained doses estimated at  roentgens and vomited, but survived. the vast majority of pripyat residents slept through the distant sound of the explosion, including station engineer breus, who only became aware at am, the beginning of his next work shift. he was later taken to hospital and, while there, made the acquaintance of one teen who had ventured out alone by bicycle to watch the roof fires during the night, stopping for a time and viewing the scene at the bridge of death .n .e / .; . . contrary to this sensationalist label, the youthful night biker was treated and released from hospital, remaining in touch with breus as of .most serious cases of ars were treated with the assistance of american specialist robert peter gale, who documented a first of its kind treatment and supervized a number of bone marrow transplant procedures which were not successful. in , gale wrote a letter to correct the popularized, though egregious, portrayal of his patients as dangerous to visitors. all those who died were station operators and firefighters, over half of which from the continued wearing of dusty soaked uniforms, causing beta burns to cover large areas of skin. in the first few minutes to days,  the betatogamma energy ratio is some . owing to the large area of burned skin and sensitivity of the gi tract, bacterial infection was and remains the overarching concern to those affected with ars, as a leading cause of death, quarantine from the outside environment is a part of the normal treatment protocol. many of the surviving firefighters, continue to have skin that is atrophied, spider veined with underlying fibrosis due to experiencing extensive beta burns.

in the  years following the accident,  more people who had been initially hospitalized  died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure. only two of these deaths were the result of myelodysplastic syndrome. scientific consensus, in the form of the chernobyl forum, suggests that, although unexpected, there has been no statistically significant increase in the incidence rate of solid cancers among rescue workers. followup studies have also found this to be the case, with apparent increases in thyroid cancer simply attributed to more meticulous cancer screening for rescue workers.childhood thyroid cancer is an exception, with approximately , new incidents in the general population by  within contaminated regions of belarus, russia, and ukraine, most of which are attributed to high environmental levels of radioactive iodine shortly after the accident. the recovery rate is , with only  terminal cases  at the time of the report. there has been no increase in mutation rate among the children of the liquidators or general population living in the contaminated areas.from this same report is also a commonly cited estimate for potential future cancer fatalities in the form of an increase in cancer mortality  which speculated that, at worst, , additional cancerrelated fatalities were to be expected. although it is reasonable and forwardthinking to assume that an increase in mortality has occurred among the affected population, studies have yet to confirm such an increase with meaningful statistical certainty.  

psychosomatic illness and posttraumatic stress, resulting from widespread fear of radiological disease, is a much greater issue impacting many more people with lethal health effects, especially as it receives relatively little attention from the general public. people who believe they or others have been impacted by radiological illness, erroneous or otherwise, exhibit greater issues with feelings of no control or fatalistic/pessimistic outlooks, leading to harmful behaviors, such as a lack of initiative to treat diseases. such fears are further strengthened by poor public understanding of the effects of radiation.whether the area was publicly announced as a contaminated area is a better predictor of general health than the contamination itself. resettlement status is an even stronger predictor the residents of contaminated regions who were evacuated and resettled into uncontaminated regions can be compared with the residents who remained in the contaminated regions. resettled citizens erroneously believed they had an illness related to radiation exposure more often than citizens who remained in the contaminated regions. this brings into question the effectiveness of resettlement.such psychological distresses can also significantly increase cancer mortality rates, possibly as much as , nearly double, resulting in as many as , additional cancer mortalities among the liquidators. from this accident, the fear of radiological illness has been more of a detriment, and potentially more lethal, upon the lives of affected people than the illnesses themselves and, unlike radioactive contaminants, shows no signs of diminishing in the near future.by , the number of ukrainians claiming to be radiation sufferers  and receiving state benefits had jumped to . million, or  of the population. many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current chernobyl plant workers. there was and remains a motivated push to achieve sufferer status as it gives access to state benefits and medical services that would otherwise not be made available. the apparent increases of ill health in this large group result partly from increased medical vigilance following the accident; many benign cases that would previously have gone unnoticed and untreated  are now being registered.of all , belarusian emergency workers, by the mids their government reported that only   died. in contrast, in the much larger work force from ukraine, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, some , casualties from a host of nonaccident causes, were reported among ukrainian cleanup workers up to the year , by the national committee for radiation protection of the ukrainian population.in september , the iaea held an advisory group meeting at the curie institute in paris on the medical handling of the skin lesions relating to the acute deaths.

the four most harmful radionuclides spread from chernobyl were iodine, caesium, caesium and strontium, with halflives of . days, . years, . years and . years respectively. the iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short halflife, but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems. strontium is the least volatile of the four and is of main concern in the areas near chernobyl itself.iodine tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands, leading, among other things, to increased incidence of thyroid cancers. the total ingested dose was largely from iodine and, unlike the other fission products, rapidly found its way from dairy farms to human ingestion. similarly in dose reconstruction, for those evacuated at different times and from various towns, the inhalation dose was dominated by iodine , along with airborne tellurium  and oxides of rubidium  both as equally secondary, appreciable contributors.long term hazards such as caesium tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart, while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to bonemarrow and lymphocytes. radiation is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing. in adult mammals cell division is slow, except in hair follicles, skin, bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness.

the two primary individuals involved with the attempt to suggest that the mutation rate among animals was, and continues to be, higher in the chernobyl zone, are the anders moller and timothy mousseau group. apart from continuing to publish experimentally unrepeatable and discredited papers, mousseau routinely gives talks at the helen caldicott organized symposiums for physicians for social responsibility, an antinuclear advocacy group devoted to bring about a nuclear free planet. in years past, moller was previously caught and reprimanded for publishing papers that crossed the scientific misconduct/fraud line. the duo have more recently attempted to publish metaanalyses, in which the primary references they weighup, analyse and draw their conclusions from is their own prior papers along with the discredited book chernobyl consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment.

in , geneticist colleagues ronald chesser and robert baker published a paper on the thriving vole population within the exclusion zone, in which the central conclusion of their work was essentially that the mutation rate in these animals is hundreds and probably thousands of times greater than normal. this claim occurred after they had done a comparison of the mitochondrial dna of the chernobyl voles with that of a control group of voles from outside the region. the paper appeared on the front cover of the journal nature. not long after publication, the authors discovered they had incorrectly classified the species of vole and therefore were genetically comparing two entirely different vole species. they issued a retraction in .

following the accident, journalists mistrusted many medical professionals , and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them. throughout the european continent, due to this mediadriven framing of the contamination, many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from chernobyl.

worldwide, an estimated excess of about , elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of fears of radiation from chernobyl, according to robert baker and ultimately a  article published by linda e. ketchum in the journal of nuclear medicine which mentions but does not reference an iaea source on the matter.the available statistical data excludes the sovietukrainebelarus abortion rates, as they are presently unavailable. from the available data, an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in denmark occurred in the months following the accident, at a rate of about  cases. in italy, a slightly above the expected number of induced abortions occurred, approximately .  in greece, following the accident, many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation. although it was determined that the effective dose to greeks would not exceed one msv , a dose much lower than that which it was determined would induce embryonic abnormalities or other nonstochastic effects, there was an observed , increase of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated.no evidence of changes in the prevalence of human deformities/birth congenital anomalies that might be associated with the accident are apparent in belarus or ukraine, the two republics that had the highest exposure to fallout. in sweden and in finland where no increase in abortion rates occurred, it was likewise determined that no association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations was found. a similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined by assessing the hungarian congenital abnormality registry. findings were also mirrored in austria.larger mainly western european data sets, approaching a million births in the eurocat database, divided into exposed and control groups were assessed in . as no chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude in retrospect, the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified. despite studies from germany and turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects, in greece, denmark, italy etc., due to the anxieties that were created.in very high doses, it was known at the time that radiation could cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, but unlike the dominant linear nothreshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases, it was known, by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing, that the malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which, no rate increase is observed. this teratology  issue was discussed by frank castronovo of the harvard medical school in , publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the chernobyl accident, inclusive of data from kievs two largest obstetrics hospitals.castronovo concludes that the lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is, together with dubious studies that show selection bias, the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that chernobyl increased the background rate of birth defects. when the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this perception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations, no inutero individuals would have been expected to have received a threshold dose.studies of low statistical significance on some of the most contaminated and proximal regions of ukraine and belarus, tentatively argue with some  children who were irradiated by the accident in utero during weeks  to  of gestation had an increased rate of intellectual disability, lower verbal iq, and possibly other negative effects. these findings may be due to confounding factors or annual variations in random chance.the chernobyl liquidators, essentially an allmale civil defense emergency workforce, would go on to father normal children, without an increase in developmental anomalies or a statistically significant increase in the frequencies of germline mutations in their progeny. this normality is similarly seen in the children of the survivors of the goiânia accident.a  study based on wholegenome sequencing of children of parents employed as liquidators indicated no transgenerational genetic effects of exposure of parents to ionizing radiation.

a report by the international atomic energy agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident. the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident equivalent on average to  additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation; individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed, including , primarily male recovery workers  who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra  years of typical natural background radiation exposure each.estimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously; disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortalitywhether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide, and whether the deaths are immediate, short term, or long term. in , thirtyone deaths were directly attributed to the accident, all among the reactor staff and emergency workers.the chernobyl forum predicts that the eventual death toll could reach , among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation ; this figure is a total causal death toll prediction, combining the deaths of approximately  emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome,  children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of , deaths from radiationinduced cancer and leukaemia.in a peerreviewed paper in the international journal of cancer in , the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of europe  they stated, without entering into a discussion on deaths, that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident

the risk projections suggest that by now  chernobyl may have caused about  cases of thyroid cancer and  cases of other cancers in europe, representing about . of all incident cancers since the accident. models predict that by  about , cases of thyroid cancer and , cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident, whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes.

two antinuclear advocacy groups have publicized nonpeerreviewed estimates that include mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation. the union of concerned scientists  calculated that, among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide, there will be an eventual , excess cancer cases, resulting in , excess cancer deaths, excluding thyroid cancer. however, these calculations are based on a simple linear nothreshold model multiplication and the misapplication of the collective dose, which the international commission on radiological protection  states should not be done as using the collective dose is inappropriate to use in risk projections.along similar lines to the ucs approach, the  torch report, commissioned by the european greens political party, likewise simplistically calculates an eventual , to , excess cancer deaths in total, around the globe.

yet the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same as prior to the technology. for these and other reasons, it is suggested that no reliable increase has been detected in the environs of chernobyl, that cannot otherwise be explained as an artifact of the globally well documented screening effect.

in , the un collaborative, chernobyl forum, revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the chernobyl accident. this is due to the ingestion of contaminated dairy products, along with the inhalation of the shortlived, highly radioactive isotope, iodine. in that publication, more than , cases of childhood thyroid cancer were reported. it is important to note that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia. it said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population. the whos radiation program reported that the , cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths.according to the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation, up to the year , an excess of more than , cases of thyroid cancer had been reported. that is, over the estimated preaccident baseline thyroid cancer rate, more than , casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident, a number that is expected to increase. they concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure.welldifferentiated thyroid cancers are generally treatable, and when treated the fiveyear survival rate of thyroid cancer is , and  after  years. the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation had reported  deaths from thyroid cancer in . the international atomic energy agency  also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities, or solid cancerssuch as lung cancercorroborating the assessments by the un committee. unscear raised the possibility of long term genetic defects, pointing to a doubling of radiationinduced minisatellite mutations among children born in . however, the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies.the german affiliate of the antinuclear energy organization, the international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war suggest that , people are affected by thyroid cancer as of , and that , cases are expected in the future.

fred mettler, a radiation expert at the university of new mexico, puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at perhaps ,, for a total of , chernobylassociated fatal cancers, saying the number is small  relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer, but the numbers are large in absolute terms. the same report outlined studies based on data found in the russian registry from  to  that suggested that of , russian workers exposed to an average dose of  msv about five percent of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure.the report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation. according to the iaea the designation of the affected population as victims rather than survivors has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future. the iaea says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects.fred mettler commented that  years later the population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding. a number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex. to reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years, although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise. in addition, disadvantaged children around chernobyl experience health problems that are attributable not only to the chernobyl accident, but also to the poor state of postsoviet health systems.the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation , part of the chernobyl forum, have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects. unscear was set up as a collaboration between various united nation bodies, including the world health organization, after the atomic bomb attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki, to assess the longterm effects of radiation on human health.

the number of potential deaths arising from the chernobyl disaster is heavily debated. the world health organizations prediction of , future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the linear nothreshold model , which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose. radiation epidemiologist roy shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the lnt model is not wise because of the uncertainties.according to the union of concerned scientists the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide  is approximately , based on the same lnt.another study critical of the chernobyl forum report was commissioned by greenpeace, which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in belarus, russia and ukraine the accident could have resulted in ,, additional deaths in the period between  and . the scientific secretary of the chernobyl forum criticized the reports reliance on nonpeerreviewed locally produced studies. although most of the studys sources were from peerreviewed journals, including many western medical journals, the higher mortality estimates were from nonpeerreviewed sources, while gregory härtl  suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology.chernobyl consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment is a  russian publication that concludes that there were , premature deaths as a consequence of the radioactivity released. the results were criticized by m. i. balonov from the institute of radiation hygiene in st. petersburg, who described them as biased, drawing from sources that were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base. balanov expressed his opinion that the authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyse the content of the russianlanguage publications, for example, to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions.according to u.s. nuclear regulatory commission member and professor of health physics kenneth mossman, the lnt philosophy is overly conservative, and lowlevel radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed. yoshihisa matsumoto, a radiation biologist at the tokyo institute of technology, cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which dna repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage. mossman suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a prudent public health policy.another significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the chernobyl accident. since , large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care, on socioeconomic stability, and the manner in which statistical data is collected. ronald chesser, a radiation biologist at texas tech university, says that the subsequent soviet collapse, scarce funding, imprecise dosimetry, and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability.

it is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. according to mikhail gorbachev, the soviet union spent  billion rbls  on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself. in , the total cost over  years for belarus which includes the monthly payments to liquidators, was estimated at us billion; about  billion in todays dollars given inflation rates. gorbachev in april  wrote the nuclear meltdown at chernobyl  years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the soviet union.ongoing costs are well known; in their  report, the chernobyl forum stated that between five and seven percent of government spending in ukraine is still related to chernobyl, while in belarus more than  billion is thought to have been spent between  and , with  of national budget having been chernobylrelated in , falling to six percent by . in , ukraine spent five to seven percent of its national budget on recovery activities related to the chernobyl disaster. overall economic loss is estimated at  billion in belarus. much of the current cost relates to the payment of chernobylrelated social benefits to some seven million people across the three countries.a significant economic impact at the time was the removal of , ha  of agricultural land and , ha  of forest from production. while much of this has been returned to use, agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques, fertilizers and additives. politically, the accident gave great significance to the new soviet policy of glasnost, and helped forge closer sovietus relations at the end of the cold war, through bioscientific cooperation. the disaster also became a key factor in the dissolution of the soviet union in , and a major influence in shaping the new eastern europe.both ukraine and belarus, in their first months of independence, lowered legal radiation thresholds from the soviet unions previous, elevated thresholds .,ukrainians viewed the chernobyl disaster as another attempt by russians to destroy them, comparable to the holodomor. meanwhile, commentators have argued that the events of the chernobyl disaster were uniquely inclined to occur in a communist country versus a capitalist country. it has been argued that soviet power plant administrators were not empowered to make crucial decisions when time was of the essence.mikhail gorbachev, the final leader of the soviet union, stated in respect to the chernobyl disaster that, more than anything else,  opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the  system as we knew it could no longer continue.a famous austrian alpine farmer sepp holzer reported decades later that the chernobyl disaster had ruined his business selling edible mushrooms  despite the fact that our mushrooms were obviously not contaminated, overnight it became impossible to sell them.

following the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. all work on the unfinished reactors no.  and no.  was halted three years later. however, the trouble at the chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in reactor no. . the damaged reactor was sealed off and  cubic meters  of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings. the work was managed by grigoriy mihaylovich naginskiy, the deputy chief engineer of installation and construction directorate  . the ukrainian government allowed the three remaining reactors to continue operating because of an energy shortage in the country.

in october , a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor no. ; the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair, and it was taken offline. reactor no.  was decommissioned in november  as part of a deal between the ukrainian government and international organizations such as the iaea to end operations at the plant. on  december , thenpresident leonid kuchma personally turned off reactor no.  in an official ceremony, shutting down the entire site.

soon after the accident, the reactor building was quickly encased by a mammoth concrete sarcophagus in a notable feat of construction under severe conditions. crane operators worked blindly from inside leadlined cabins taking instructions from distant radio observers, while gargantuansized pieces of concrete were moved to the site on custommade vehicles. the purpose of the sarcophagus was to stop any further release of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, isolate the exposed core from the weather and provide safety for the continued operations of adjacent reactors one through three.the concrete sarcophagus was never intended to last very long, with a lifespan of only  years. on  february , a  m  section of the roof of the turbinebuilding collapsed, adjacent to the sarcophagus, causing a new release of radioactivity and temporary evacuation of the area. at first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow, however the amount of snow was not exceptional, and the report of a ukrainian factfinding panel concluded that the collapse was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure. experts warned the sarcophagus itself was on the verge of collapse.in , the international chernobyl shelter fund was founded to design and build a more permanent cover for the unstable and shortlived sarcophagus. it received  million from international donors in  and was managed by the european bank for reconstruction and development . the new shelter was named the new safe confinement and construction began in . it is a metal arch  metres  high and spanning  metres  built on rails adjacent to the reactor no.  building so that it could be slid over the top of the existing sarcophagus. the new safe confinement was completed in  and slid into place over top the sarcophagus on  november. the huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks. unlike the original sarcophagus, the new safe confinement is designed to allow the reactor to be safely dismantled using remotely operated equipment.

used fuel from units  was stored in the units cooling ponds, and in an interim spent fuel storage facility pond, isf, which now holds most of the spent fuel from units , allowing those reactors to be decommissioned under less restrictive conditions. approximately  of the fuel assemblies from units  and  were damaged and required special handling. moving fuel to isf was thus carried out in three stages fuel from unit  was moved first, then all undamaged fuel from units  and , and finally the damaged fuel from units  and . fuel transfers to isf were completed in june .a need for larger, longerterm radioactive waste management at the chernobyl site is to be fulfilled by a new facility designated isf. this facility is to serve as dry storage for used fuel assemblies from units  and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units  .a contract was signed in  with areva np  for construction of isf. in , after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the design concept became apparent. in , areva withdrew and holtec international was contracted for a new design and construction of isf. the new design was approved in , work started in , and construction was completed in august .isf is the worlds largest nuclear fuel storage facility, expected to hold more than , fuel assemblies for at least  years. the project includes a processing facility able to cut the rbmk fuel assemblies and to place the material in canisters, to be filled with inert gas and welded shut. the canisters are then to be transported to dry storage vaults, where the fuel containers will be enclosed for up to  years. expected processing capacity is , fuel assemblies per year.

according to official estimates, about  of the fuel in reactor no.  at the time of the accident  remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly  million curies . the radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lavalike fuel containing materials also called coriumthat flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form.

three different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black, brown, and a porous ceramic. the lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them. the porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly. it is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. from  to , a series of published papers suggested that the selfirradiation of the lava would convert all , tonnes  into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks.it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow, gradual process, rather than sudden and rapid. the same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only  kg  per year; this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment. the paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease. as of , some fuel had already degraded significantly. the famous elephants foot, which originally was so hard that it required the use of an armor piercing ak round to remove a chunk, had softened to a texture similar to sand.prior to the completion of the new safe confinement building, rainwater acted as a neutron moderator, triggering increased fission in the remaining materials, risking criticality. gadolinium nitrate solution was used to quench neutrons to slow the fission. even after completion of the building, fission reactions may be increasing; scientists are working to understand the cause and risks. while neutron activity has declined across most of the destroyed fuel, from  until late  a doubling in neutron density was recorded in the subreactor space, before levelling off in early . this indicated increasing levels of fission as water levels dropped, the opposite of what had been expected, and atypical compared to other fuelcontaining areas. the fluctuations have led to fears that a selfsustaining reaction could be created, which would likely spread more radioactive dust and debris throughout the new safe confinement, making future cleanup even more difficult. potential solutions include using a robot to drill into the fuel and insert boron carbide control rods. in early , a chnpp press release stated that the observed increase in neutron densities had leveled off since the beginning of that year.

the exclusion zone was originally an area with a radius of  kilometres  in all directions from the plant, but was subsequently greatly enlarged to include an area measuring approximately , km , officially called the zone of alienation. the area has largely reverted to forest and was overrun by wildlife due to the lack of human competition for space and resources.some sources have estimated when the site could be considered habitable again

tens of thousands of years in the years following the disaster, residents known as samosely illegally returned to their abandoned homes to regain their lives. most people are retired and survive mainly from farming and packages delivered by visitors. as of ,  locals had returned to the zone and were living permanently there.in , ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the chernobyl reactor to tourists wishing to learn more about the  tragedy. sergii mirnyi, a radiation reconnaissance officer at the time of the accident, and now an academic at national university of kyivmohyla academy, has written about the psychological and physical effects on survivors and visitors, and worked as an advisor to chernobyl tourism groups.

during the dry season, forest fires are a perennial concern in areas contaminated by radioactive material. dry conditions and buildup of debris make the forests a ripe breeding ground for wildfires. depending on prevailing atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires could potentially spread more radioactive material outside the exclusion zone. in belarus, the bellesrad organization is tasked with overseeing food cultivation and forestry management in the area.

in april , forest fires spread through , hectares  of the exclusion zone, causing increased radiation from the release of caesium and strontium from the ground and biomass. the increase in radioactivity was detectable by the monitoring network but did not pose a threat to human health. the average radiation dose that kyiv residents received as a result of the fires was estimated to be  nsv.

the chernobyl trust fund was created in  by the united nations to help victims of the chernobyl accident. it is administered by the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, which also manages strategy formulation, resource mobilization, and advocacy efforts. beginning in , under the united nations development programme, the fund shifted its focus from emergency assistance to longterm development.the chernobyl shelter fund was established in  at the g summit in denver to finance the shelter implementation plan . the plan called for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition through stabilization of the sarcophagus and construction of a new safe confinement  structure. while the original cost estimate for the sip was us million, the  estimate was . billion. the sip is being managed by a consortium of bechtel, battelle, and électricité de france, and conceptual design for the nsc consisted of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, then slid over the sarcophagus. the nsc was moved into position in november  and was expected to be completed by late .in , the united nations development programme launched the chernobyl recovery and development programme  for the recovery of affected areas. the programme was initiated in february  based on the recommendations in the report on human consequences of the chernobyl nuclear accident. the main goal of the crdp was supporting the government of ukraine in mitigating longterm social, economic, and ecological consequences of the chernobyl catastrophe. crdp works in the four most affected ukrainian areas kyivska, zhytomyrska, chernihivska and rivnenska.

more than , ukrainian children affected by the disaster have been treated in the resort town of tarará, cuba since .the international project on the health effects of the chernobyl accident was created and received us million, mainly from japan, in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to iodine radiation. these funds were divided among ukraine, belarus, and russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects. as there was significant corruption in former soviet countries, most of the foreign aid was given to russia, and no results from the funding were demonstrated.in , it became known that the ukrainian government in power at the time aimed to make chernobyl a tourist attraction.

the chernobyl accident attracted a great deal of interest. because of the distrust that many people had in the soviet authorities, which engaged in a major coverup of the disaster, a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the first world during the early days of the event. because of defective intelligence based on satellite imagery, it was thought that unit number three had also had a dire accident. journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.the accident raised already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide, and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design, hundreds of disparate nuclear reactor proposals, including those under construction at chernobyl, reactors numbers  and , were eventually cancelled. with ballooning costs as a result of new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal and political costs in dealing with the increasingly hostile/anxious public opinion, there was a precipitous drop in the rate of new reactor construction after .

the accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the soviet nuclear power industry, slowing industry growth and forcing the soviet government to become less secretive about its operating procedures. the government coverup of the chernobyl disaster was a catalyst for glasnost, which paved the way for reforms leading to the soviet collapse. numerous structural and construction quality issues, as well as deviations from the original plant design, had been known to kgb since at least  and passed on to the central committee, which took no action and classified the information.in italy, the chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the  referendum. as a result of that referendum, italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in , a decision that was effectively reversed in . a  referendum reiterated italians strong objections to nuclear power, thus abrogating the governments  decision.in germany, the chernobyl accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry, after several states had already created such a post. the post has been held, among others, by angela merkel who would later become leader of the opposition and then chancellor. the german environmental minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well, a responsibility the current minister still holds today. the chernobyl disaster is also credited with strengthening the antinuclear movement in germany, which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power made by the  schröder government. a temporary reversal of this policy was in turn reverted after the fukushima nuclear disaster.

in direct response to the chernobyl disaster, a conference to create a convention on early notification of a nuclear accident was called in  by the international atomic energy agency. the resulting treaty has bound signatory member states to provide notification of any nuclear and radiation accidents that occur within its jurisdiction that could affect other states, along with the convention on assistance in the case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency.the chernobyl disaster, along with the space shuttle challenger disaster, the three mile island accident, and the bhopal disaster have been used together as case studies, both by the us government and by third parties, in research concerning the root causes of such disasters, such as sleep deprivation and mismanagement.

the chernobyl tragedy has inspired many artists across the world to create works of art, animation, video games, theatre and cinema about the disaster. the hbo series chernobyl and the book voices from chernobyl by the ukrainianbelarusian writer svetlana alexievich are two wellknown works that talk about the catastrophe that destroyed millions of lives. the ukrainian artist roman gumanyuk created a series of artworks called pripyat lights, or chernobyl shadows that includes  oil paintings about the chernobyl accident. the series of artwork was exhibited at the national fine art museum of kyrgyzstan in bishkek, the kasteev state museum of arts of kazakhstan in almaty, the vashchenko art gallery of gomel in belarus, and at the museum of chernobyl in kharkiv in ukraine in the years .the video game s.t.a.l.k.e.r. shadows of chernobyl released by thq in , is a firstperson shooter set in the exclusion zone. a prequel called s.t.a.l.k.e.r. clear sky was released in  following with a sequel s.t.a.l.k.e.r. call of pripyat released in . finally, the horror film chernobyl diaries released in  is about six tourists that hire a tour guide to take them to the abandoned city of pripyat where they discover they are not alone.filmmakers have created documentaries that examine the aftermath of the disaster over the years. documentaries like the oscarwinning chernobyl heart released in , explore how radiation affected people living in the area and information about the longterm side effects of radiation exposure over the years that include mental disabilities, physical disabilities, and genetic mutations after the disaster.the babushkas of chernobyl released in , is a documentary that explores the story of the three women who decided to return to the exclusion zone after the disaster. in the documentary, the babushkas show the polluted water, their food from radioactive gardens, and explain how they manage to survive in this exclusion zone despite the radioactive levels of it. the documentary the battle of chernobyl, released in , shows a rare original footage a day before the disaster in the city of pripyat, then through different methods the documentary goes in depth on the chronological events that led to the explosion of the reactor no.  and the disaster response in which , men from soviet union engaged to liquidate the radioactivity of the damaged reactor.

in july , ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy announced that the chernobyl site would become an official tourist attraction. zelenskyy said, we must give this territory of ukraine a new life, after chernobyl saw an increase in visitors since the hbo miniseries. dr. t. steen, a microbiology and immunology teacher at georgetowns school of medicine, recommends tourists to wear clothes and shoes they are comfortable with throwing away. most importantly, steen suggests to avoid plant life, especially the depths of the forest due to the high levels of radiation. because the areas were not cleaned in the aftermath of the disaster, they remain highly contaminated. research showed that fungus, moss, and mushrooms are radioactive. drinking or eating from there could be dangerous. generally speaking, chernobyl can be a safe place, dr. steen said, but it depends on how people behave.

elvis aaron presley , commonly referred by his first name, was an american singer and actor. known as the king of rock and roll, he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the th century. presleys energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.

presley was born in tupelo, mississippi, and relocated to memphis, tennessee, with his family at age . his music career began there in , recording at sun records with producer sam phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of africanamerican music to a wider audience. presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist scotty moore and bassist bill black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeatdriven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. in , drummer d. j. fontana joined to complete the lineup of presleys classic quartet and rca victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by colonel tom parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. presleys first rca single, heartbreak hotel, was released in january  and became a numberone hit in the united states. within a year, rca would sell ten million presley singles. with a series of successful television appearances and charttopping records, presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the thenmarginalized sound of african americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral wellbeing of white american youth.in november , presley made his film debut in love me tender. drafted into military service in , he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. presley held few concerts, however, and guided by parker, proceeded to devote much of the s to making hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. some of his most famous films included jailhouse rock , blue hawaii , and viva las vegas . in , following a sevenyear break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special elvis, which led to an extended las vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. in , presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, aloha from hawaii. however, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and presley died suddenly in  at his graceland estate at the age of .

having sold roughly  million records worldwide, presley is one of the bestselling music artists of all time. he was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm  blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. he won three grammy awards, received the grammy lifetime achievement award at age , and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. he also holds several records, including the most riaacertified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the billboard , the most numberone albums by a solo artist on the uk albums chart, and the most numberone singles by any act on the uk singles chart. in , presley was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom.

elvis aaron presley was born on january , , in tupelo, mississippi, to vernon presley and gladys love  presley in a tworoom shotgun house that his father built for the occasion. elvis identical twin, jesse garon presley, was delivered stillborn thirtyfive minutes before him. presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. the family attended an assembly of god church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.

presleys father was of irish, german, scottish, and english origins, and a descendant of the harrison family of virginia. presleys mother gladys was scotsirish with some norman french ancestry. she and the rest of the family believed that her greatgreatgrandmother, morning dove white, was cherokee. this belief was restated by elviss granddaughter riley keough in . elaine dundy, in her biography, supports the belief.vernon moved from one odd job to the next, showing little ambition. the family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. in  they lost their home after vernon was found guilty of altering a check. he was jailed for eight months while gladys and elvis moved in with relatives.in september , presley entered first grade at east tupelo consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as average. he was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of red foleys country song old shep during morning prayers. the contest, held at the mississippialabama fair and dairy show on october , , was his first public performance. the tenyearold presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang old shep. he recalled placing fifth. a few months later, presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something elseby different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and a pastor at the familys church. presley recalled, i took the guitar, and i watched people, and i learned to play a little bit. but i would never sing in public. i was very shy about it.in september , presley entered a new school, milam, for sixth grade; he was regarded as a loner. the following year, he began bringing his guitar to school. he played and sang during lunchtime and was often teased as a trashy kid who played hillbilly music. presley was a devotee of mississippi slims show on the tupelo radio station welo. he was described as crazy about music by slims younger brother, who was one of presleys classmates and often took him into the station. slim supplemented presleys guitar instruction by demonstrating chord techniques. when his protégé was aged , slim scheduled him for two onair performances. presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.

in november , the family moved to memphis, tennessee. after residing for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a twobedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the lauderdale courts. enrolled at l. c. humes high school, presley received only a c in music in eighth grade. when his music teacher told him that he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, keep them cold icy fingers off me, to prove otherwise. a classmate later recalled that the teacher agreed that elvis was right when he said that she didnt appreciate his kind of singing. he was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a mamas boy.in , presley began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of lee denson, a neighbor. they and three other boysincluding two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers dorsey and johnny burnetteformed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the courts. that september, presley began working as an usher at loews state theater. other jobs followed at precision tool, another stint at loews, and marl metal products.

during his junior year, presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance he grew his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and vaseline. in his free time, he would head down to beale street, the heart of memphis thriving blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of lansky brothers. by his senior year, he was wearing those clothes. overcoming his reticence about performing outside the courts, he competed in humes annual minstrel show in april . singing and playing guitar, he opened with till i waltz again with you, a recent hit for teresa brewer. presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation i wasnt popular in school ... i failed musiconly thing i ever failed. and then they entered me in this talent show ... when i came onstage, i heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, cause nobody knew i even sang. it was amazing how popular i became in school after that.

presley, who received no formal music training and could not read music, studied and played by ear. he also visited record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths to customers. he knew all of hank snows songs, and he loved records by other country singers such as roy acuff, ernest tubb, ted daffan, jimmie rodgers, jimmie davis, and bob wills. the southern gospel singer jake hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his balladsinging style. presley was a regular audience member at the monthly allnight singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of african american spiritual music. he adored the music of black gospel singer sister rosetta tharpe.presley listened to regional radio stations, such as wdia, that played what were then called race records spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeatheavy sound of rhythm and blues. like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiencesa necessity in the segregated south. many of his future recordings were inspired by local africanamerican musicians such as arthur crudup and rufus thomas. b.b. king recalled that he had known presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent beale street. by the time he graduated from high school in june , presley had already singled out music as his future.

in august , presley checked into the offices of memphis recording service, the company run by sam phillips before he started sun records. he aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a twosided acetate disc my happiness and thats when your heartaches begin. he later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he sounded like, although there was a much cheaper, amateur recordmaking service at a nearby general store. biographer peter guralnick argued that presley chose sun in the hope of being discovered. asked by receptionist marion keisker what kind of singer he was, presley responded, i sing all kinds. when she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, i dont sound like nobody. after he recorded, phillips asked keisker to note down the young mans name, which she did along with her own commentary good ballad singer. hold.in january , presley cut a second acetate at sunill never stand in your way and it wouldnt be the same without youbut again nothing came of it. not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the songfellows, explaining to his father, they told me i couldnt sing. songfellow jim hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time. in april, presley began working for the crown electric company as a truck driver. his friend ronnie smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact eddie bond, leader of smiths professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. bond rejected him after a tryout, advising presley to stick to truck driving because youre never going to make it as a singer.phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom sun focused. as keisker reported, over and over i remember sam saying, if i could find a white man who had the negro sound and the negro feel, i could make a billion dollars. in june, he acquired a demo recording by jimmy sweeney of a ballad, without you, that he thought might suit presley. the teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. despite this, phillips asked presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. he was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist winfield scotty moore and upright bass player bill black, to work something up with presley for a recording session.

the session, held the evening of july , proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. as they were about to abort and go home, presley took his guitar and launched into a  blues number, arthur crudups thats all right. moore recalled, all of a sudden, elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and i started playing with them. sam, i think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, what are you doing and we said, we dont know. well, back up, he said, try to find a place to start, and do it again. phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.three days later, popular memphis disc jockey dewey phillips  played thats all right on his red, hot, and blue show. listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. the interest was such that phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. interviewing presley onair, phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black. during the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass song, bill monroes blue moon of kentucky, again in a distinctive style and employing a juryrigged echo effect that sam phillips dubbed slapback. a single was pressed with thats all right on the aside and blue moon of kentucky on the reverse.

the trio played publicly for the first time at the bon air club on july , presley still sporting his childsize guitar. at the end of the month, they appeared at the overton park shell, with slim whitman headlining. here elvis pioneered rubber legs, his signature style dance movement that he is best known for. a combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led presley to shake his legs as he performed his widecut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming. moore recalled, during the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild. black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that presley would later remember as really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something.soon after, moore and black left their old band, the starlite wranglers, to play with presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter bob neal became the trios manager. from august through october, they played frequently at the eagles nest club, a dance venue on the second floor of the clearpool recreation complex in memphis. when presley played his fifteenminute sets, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house western swing band resumed. presley quickly grew more confident on stage. according to moore, his movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. hed do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick. amid these live performances, presley returned to sun studio for more recording sessions. presley made what would be his only appearance on nashvilles grand ole opry on october ; after a polite audience response, opry manager jim denny told phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit the program.

in november , presley performed on louisiana hayridethe oprys chief, and more adventurous, rival. the shreveportbased show was broadcast to  radio stations in  states. presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. a more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. house drummer d. j. fontana brought a new element, complementing presleys movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs. soon after the show, the hayride engaged presley for a years worth of saturdaynight appearances. trading in his old guitar for  , he purchased a martin instrument for   and his trio began playing in new locales, including houston, texas, and texarkana, arkansas.many fledgling performers, like minnie pearl, johnny horton, and johnny cash, sang the praises of louisiana hayride sponsor southern maid donuts, including presley, who developed a lifelong love of donuts. presley made his singular product endorsement commercial for the donut company, which was never released, recording a radio jingle in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts. presley made his first television appearance on the kslatv television broadcast of louisiana hayride. soon after, he failed an audition for arthur godfreys talent scouts on the cbs television network. by early , presleys regular hayride appearances, constant touring, and wellreceived record releases had made him a regional star, from tennessee to west texas.in january, neal signed a formal management contract with presley and brought him to the attention of colonel tom parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. parker, born in the netherlands, had immigrated illegally to the u.s. and claimed to be from west virginia; he had acquired an honorary colonels commission from the louisiana governor and country singer jimmie davis. having successfully managed the top country star eddy arnold, parker was working with the new numberone country singer, hank snow. parker booked presley on snows february tour. when the tour reached odessa, texas, a yearold roy orbison saw presley for the first time his energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing. ... i just didnt know what to make of it. there was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.by august, sun had released ten sides credited to elvis presley, scotty and bill; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. some of the songs, like thats all right, were in what one memphis journalist described as the rb idiom of negro field jazz; others, like blue moon of kentucky, were more in the country field, but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both. this blend of styles made it difficult for presleys music to find radio airplay. according to neal, many countrymusic disc jockeys would not play it because presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rb stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly. the blend came to be known as rockabilly. at the time, presley was variously billed as the king of western bop, the hillbilly cat, and the memphis flash.presley renewed neals management contract in august , simultaneously appointing parker as his special adviser. the group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year. neal recalled, it was almost frightening, the reaction that came to elvis from the teenaged boys. so many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. there were occasions in some towns in texas when wed have to be sure to have a police guard because somebodyd always try to take a crack at him. theyd get a gang and try to waylay him or something. the trio became a quartet when hayride drummer fontana joined as a full member. in midoctober, they played a few shows in support of bill haley, whose rock around the clock track had been a numberone hit the previous year. haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.at the country disc jockey convention in early november, presley was voted the years most promising male artist. several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. after three major labels made offers of up to ,, parker and phillips struck a deal with rca victor on november  to acquire presleys sun contract for an unprecedented ,. presley, now aged , was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract. parker arranged with the owners of hill  range publishing, jean and julian aberbach, to create two entities, elvis presley music and gladys music, to handle all the new material recorded by presley. songwriters were obliged to forgo onethird of their customary royalties in exchange for having presley perform their compositions. by december, rca had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before months end had reissued many of his sun recordings.

on january , , presley made his first recordings for rca in nashville. extending his bynow customary backup of moore, black, fontana, and hayride pianist floyd cramerwho had been performing at live club dates with presleyrca enlisted guitarist chet atkins and three background singers, including gordon stoker of the popular jordanaires quartet, to fill in the sound. the session produced the moody, unusual heartbreak hotel, released as a single on january . parker finally brought presley to national television, booking him on cbss stage show for six appearances over two months. the program, produced in new york city, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers tommy and jimmy dorsey. after his first appearance, on january , presley stayed in town to record at rca victors new york studio. the sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of carl perkins rockabilly anthem blue suede shoes. in february, presleys i forgot to remember to forget, a sun recording initially released the previous august, reached the top of the billboard country chart. neals contract was terminated, and, on march , parker became presleys manager.rca released presleys selftitled debut album on march . joined by five previously unreleased sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. there were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. the others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll blue suede shoesan improvement over perkins in almost every way, according to critic robert hilburnand three rb numbers that had been part of presleys stage repertoire for some time, covers of little richard, ray charles, and the drifters. as described by hilburn, these were the most revealing of all. unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original rb versions of songs in the s, presley reshaped them. he not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases. it became the first rock and roll album to top the billboard chart, a position it held for ten weeks. while presley was not an innovative guitarist like moore or contemporary african american rockers bo diddley and chuck berry, cultural historian gilbert b. rodman argued that the albums cover image, of elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.

on april , presley made the first of two appearances on nbcs the milton berle show. his performance, on the deck of the uss hancock in san diego, california, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. a few days later, a flight taking presley and his band to nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over arkansas. twelve weeks after its original release, heartbreak hotel became presleys first numberone pop hit. in late april he began a twoweek residency at the new frontier hotel and casino on the las vegas strip. the shows were poorly received by the conservative, middleaged hotel guestslike a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party, wrote a critic for newsweek. amid his vegas tenure, presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a sevenyear contract with paramount pictures. he began a tour of the midwest in midmay, taking in fifteen cities in as many days. he had attended several shows by freddie bell and the bellboys in vegas and was struck by their cover of hound dog, a hit in  for blues singer big mama thornton by songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller. it became his new closing number.

after a show in la crosse, wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local catholic dioceses newspaper was sent to fbi director j. edgar hoover. it warned that presley is a definite danger to the security of the united states. ... his actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... after the show, more than , teenagers tried to gang into presleys room at the auditorium. ... indications of the harm presley did just in la crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had presleys autograph.

presleys second milton berle show appearance came on june  at nbcs hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. milton berle persuaded presley to leave his guitar backstage, advising, let em see you, son. during the performance, presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of hound dog with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. his gyrations created a storm of controversy. television critics were outraged jack gould of the new york times wrote, mr. presley has no discernible singing ability. ... his phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginners aria in a bathtub. ... his one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway. ben gross of the new york daily news opined that popular music has reached its lowest depths in the grunt and groin antics of one elvis presley. ... elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos. ed sullivan, whose own variety show was the nations most popular, declared presley unfit for family viewing. to presleys displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as elvis the pelvis, which he called one of the most childish expressions i ever heard, comin from an adult.

the berle shows drew such high ratings that presley was booked for a july  appearance on nbcs the steve allen show in new york. allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a new elvis in a white bow tie and black tails. presley sang hound dog for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. as described by television historian jake austen, allen thought presley was talentless and absurd ... he set things up so that presley would show his contrition. allen later wrote that he found presleys strange, gangly, countryboy charisma, his hardtodefine cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing and simply worked him into the customary comedy fabric of his program. just before the final rehearsal for the show, presley told a reporter, im holding down on this show. i dont want to do anything to make people dislike me. i think tv is important so im going to go along, but i wont be able to give the kind of show i do in a personal appearance. presley would refer back to the allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. later that night, he appeared on hy gardner calling, a popular local television show. pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, presley responded, no, i havent, i dont feel like im doing anything wrong. ... i dont see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when its only music. ... i mean, how would rock n roll music make anyone rebel against their parentsthe next day, presley recorded hound dog, along with any way you want me and dont be cruel. the jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on the steve allen show; they would work with presley through the s. a few days later, presley made an outdoor concert appearance in memphis, at which he announced, you know, those people in new york are not gonna change me none. im gonna show you what the real elvis is like tonight. in august, a judge in jacksonville, florida, ordered presley to tame his act. throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. the single pairing dont be cruel with hound dog ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeksa mark that would not be surpassed for thirtysix years. recording sessions for presleys second album took place in hollywood during the first week of september. leiber and stoller, the writers of hound dog, contributed love me.allens show with presley had, for the first time, beaten cbss the ed sullivan show in the ratings. sullivan, despite his june pronouncement, booked presley for three appearances for an unprecedented ,. the first, on september , , was seen by approximately  million viewersa record . percent of the television audience. actor charles laughton hosted the show, filling in while sullivan was recovering from a car accident. presley appeared in two segments that night from cbs television city in los angeles. according to legend, presley was shot only from the waist up. watching clips of the allen and berle shows with his producer, sullivan had opined that presley got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pantsso when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... i think its a coke bottle. ... we just cant have this on a sunday night. this is a family show sullivan publicly told tv guide, as for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots. in fact, presley was shown headtotoe in the first and second shows. though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with legconcealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style screaming. presleys performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad love me tender, prompted a recordshattering million advance orders. more than any other single event, it was this first appearance on the ed sullivan show that made presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.accompanying presleys rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. the historian marty jezer wrote that presley began the biggest pop craze since glenn miller and frank sinatra  and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture as presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generationthe first in america ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.

the audience response at presleys live shows became increasingly fevered. moore recalled, hed start out, you aint nothin but a hound dog, and theyd just go to pieces. theyd always react the same way. thered be a riot every time. at the two concerts he performed in september at the mississippialabama fair and dairy show, fifty national guardsmen were added to the police detail to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus. elvis, presleys second rca album, was released in october and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. the album includes old shep, which he sang at the talent show in , and which now marked the first time he played piano on an rca session. according to guralnick, one can hear in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique. assessing the musical and cultural impact of presleys recordings from thats all right through elvis, rock critic dave marsh wrote that these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock  roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.presley returned to the ed sullivan show at its main studio in new york, hosted this time by its namesake, on october . after the performance, crowds in nashville and st. louis burned him in effigy. his first motion picture, love me tender, was released on november . though he was not topbilled, the films original titlethe reno brotherswas changed to capitalize on his latest numberone record love me tender had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. to further take advantage of presleys popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. the film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office. presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.on december , presley dropped into sun records, where carl perkins and jerry lee lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with johnny cash. though phillips no longer had the right to release any presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. the results, none officially released for twentyfive years, became known as the million dollar quartet recordings. the year ended with a frontpage story in the wall street journal reporting that presley merchandise had brought in  million on top of his record sales, and billboards declaration that he had placed more songs in the top  than any other artist since records were first charted. in his first full year at rca victor, then the record industrys largest company, presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the labels singles sales.

presley made his third and final ed sullivan show appearance on january , on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. some commentators have claimed that parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. in any event, as critic greil marcus describes, presley did not tie himself down. leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. from the makeup over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing rudolph valentino in the sheik, with all stops out. to close, displaying his range and defying sullivans wishes, presley sang a gentle black spiritual, peace in the valley. at the end of the show, sullivan declared presley a real decent, fine boy. two days later, the memphis draft board announced that presley would be classified a and would probably be drafted sometime that year.each of the three presley singles released in the first half of  went to number one too much, all shook up, and  teddy bear. already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released. under the headline presley records a craze in soviet, the new york times reported that pressings of his music on discarded xray plates were commanding high prices in leningrad. between film shoots and recording sessions, presley purchased an room mansion, graceland, on march , , for the amount of ,. the mansion, which was about  miles  south of downtown memphis, was for himself and his parents. before the purchase, elvis recorded loving youthe soundtrack to his second film, which was released in july. it was his third straight numberone album. the title track was written by leiber and stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for jailhouse rock, presleys next film. the songwriting team effectively produced the jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with presley, who came to regard them as his goodluck charm. he was fast, said leiber. any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes. the title track became another numberone hit, as was the jailhouse rock ep.

presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. a detroit newspaper suggested that the trouble with going to see elvis presley is that youre liable to get killed. villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in philadelphia, and in vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. frank sinatra, who had inspired both the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. in a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. it smells phoney and false. it is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... this rancidsmelling aphrodisiac i deplore. asked for a response, presley said, i admire the man. he has a right to say what he wants to say. he is a great success and a fine actor, but i think he shouldnt have said it. ... this is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.leiber and stoller were again in the studio for the recording of elvis christmas album. toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at presleys request santa claus is back in town, an innuendoladen blues. the holiday release stretched presleys string of numberone albums to four and would become the bestselling christmas album ever in the united states, with eventual sales of over  million worldwide. after the session, moore and blackdrawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of presleys massive financial successresigned. though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of presleys inner circle for some time.on december , presley received his draft notice. he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film king creole, in which , had already been invested by paramount and producer hal wallis. a couple of weeks into the new year, dont, another leiber and stoller tune, became presleys tenth numberone seller. it had been only twentyone months since heartbreak hotel had brought him to the top for the first time. recording sessions for the king creole soundtrack were held in hollywood in midjanuary . leiber and stoller provided three songs and were again on hand, but it would be the last time presley and the duo worked closely together. as stoller later recalled, presleys manager and entourage sought to wall him off he was removed. ... they kept him separate. a brief soundtrack session on february  marked another endingit was the final occasion on which black was to perform with presley. he died in .

on march , , presley was drafted into the united states army at fort chaffee in arkansas. his arrival was a major media event. hundreds of people descended on presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the installation. presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else the army can do anything it wants with me.between march  and september , , presley completed basic and advanced military training at fort hood in texas, where he was temporarily assigned to company a, d medium tank battalion, th armor. during the two weeks leave between his basic and advanced training in early june, he recorded five songs in nashville. in early august, presleys mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in memphis on august . two days later, she died of heart failure at age . presley was devastated and never the same; their relationship had remained extremely closeeven into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and presley would address her with pet names.

on october , , presley was assigned to the st medium tank battalion, d armor, d armored division, at ray barracks, west germany, where he served as an armor intelligence specialist. on november , he was promoted to private first class and on june , , to specialist fourth class. while on maneuvers, presley was introduced to amphetamines by another soldier. he became practically evangelical about their benefits, not only for energy but for strength and weight loss, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. the army also introduced presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with jürgen seydel. it became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. fellow soldiers have attested to presleys wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. he donated his army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. presley was promoted to sergeant on february , .while in bad nauheim, presley, aged  at the time, met yearold priscilla beaulieu. priscilla said that due to their age difference when they met, he told her why, youre just a baby. they would eventually marry after a sevenandahalfyear courtship. in her autobiography, priscilla said that presley was concerned that his month spell in the military would ruin his career. in special services, he would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with the public, but parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier. media reports echoed presleys concerns about his career, but rca producer steve sholes and freddy bienstock of hill and range had carefully prepared for his twoyear hiatus. armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. between his induction and discharge, presley had ten top  hits, including wear my ring around your neck, the bestselling hard headed woman, and one night in , and  a fool such as i and the numberone a big hunk o love in . rca also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully elvis golden records , which hit number three on the lp chart.

presley returned to the u.s. on march , , and was honorably discharged three days later. the train that carried him from new jersey to tennessee was mobbed all the way, and presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans. on the night of march , he entered rcas nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, stuck on you, which was rushed into release and swiftly became a numberone hit. another nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his bestselling singles, the ballads its now or never and are you lonesome tonight, along with the rest of elvis is back the album features several songs described by greil marcus as full of chicago blues menace, driven by presleys own supermiked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by scotty moore, and demonic sax work from boots randolph. elvis singing wasnt sexy, it was pornographic. as a whole, the record conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things, according to music historian john robertson a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; a raucous rocker. released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.

presley returned to television on may  as a guest on the frank sinatra timex specialironic for both stars, given sinatras earlier excoriation of rock and roll. also known as welcome home elvis, the show had been taped in late march, the only time all year presley performed in front of an audience. parker secured an unheardof , fee for eight minutes of singing. the broadcast drew an enormous viewership.g.i. blues, the soundtrack to presleys first film since his return, was a numberone album in october. his first lp of sacred material, his hand in mine, followed two months later; it reached number  on the u.s. pop chart and number  in the united kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. in february , presley performed two shows for a benefit event in memphis, on behalf of twentyfour local charities. during a luncheon preceding the event, rca presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over  million records. a twelvehour nashville session in midmarch yielded nearly all of presleys next studio album, something for everybody. as described by john robertson, it exemplifies the nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the s. presaging much of what was to come from presley himself over the next halfdecade, the album is largely a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been elvis birthright. it would be his sixth numberone lp. another benefit concert, raising money for a pearl harbor memorial, was staged on march  in hawaii. it was to be presleys last public performance for seven years.

parker had by now pushed presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic veinflaming star  and wild in the country were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. among the twentyseven films he made during the s, there were a few further exceptions. his films were almost universally panned; critic andrew caine dismissed them as a pantheon of bad taste. nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. hal wallis, who produced nine of them, declared, a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood.of presleys films in the s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack eps. the films rapid production and release schedulespresley frequently starred in three a yearaffected his music. according to jerry leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for the army three ballads, one mediumtempo number, one uptempo, and one break blues boogie. as the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew progressively worse. julie parrish, who appeared in paradise, hawaiian style , says that presley disliked many of the songs chosen for his films. the jordanaires gordon stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone the material was so bad that he felt like he couldnt sing it. most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of doc pomus and mort shuman. but by and large, according to biographer jerry hopkins, the numbers seemed to be written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and roll. regardless of the songs quality, it has been argued that presley generally sang them well, with commitment. critic dave marsh heard the opposite presley isnt trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like no room to rumba in a sports car and rockahula baby.in the first half of the decade, three of presleys soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as cant help falling in love  and return to sender .  but, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished. from  through , presley had only one topten hit crying in the chapel , a gospel number recorded in . as for nonfilm albums, between the june  release of pot luck and the november  release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one lp of new material by presley was issued the gospel album how great thou art . it won him his first grammy award, for best sacred performance. as marsh described, presley was arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time and really the last rock  roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs.shortly before christmas , more than seven years since they first met, presley proposed to priscilla beaulieu. they were married on may , , in a brief ceremony in their suite at the aladdin hotel in las vegas. the flow of formulaic films and assemblyline soundtracks rolled on. it was not until october , when the clambake soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album, that rca executives recognized a problem. by then, of course, the damage had been done, as historians connie kirchberg and marc hendrickx put it. elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a hasbeen to all but his most loyal fans.

presleys only child, lisa marie, was born on february , , during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. of the eight presley singles released between january  and may , only two charted in the top , and none higher than number . his forthcoming soundtrack album, speedway, would rank at number  on the billboard chart. parker had already shifted his plans to television, where presley had not appeared since the sinatra timex show in . he maneuvered a deal with nbc that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a christmas special.recorded in late june in burbank, california, the special, simply called elvis, aired on december , . later known as the  comeback special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audiencepresleys first live performances since . the live segments saw presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. director and coproducer steve binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of christmas songs parker had originally planned. the show, nbcs highestrated that season, captured fortytwo percent of the total viewing audience. jon landau of eye magazine remarked, there is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. he sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock n roll singers. he moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made jim morrison green with envy. marsh calls the performance one of emotional grandeur and historical resonance.by january , the single if i can dream, written for the special, reached number . the soundtrack album rose into the top ten. according to friend jerry schilling, the special reminded presley of what he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... he was out of prison, man. binder said of presleys reaction, i played elvis the minute show, and he told me in the screening room, steve, its the greatest thing ive ever done in my life. i give you my word i will never sing a song i dont believe in.

buoyed by the experience of the comeback special, presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at american sound studio, which led to the acclaimed from elvis in memphis. released in june , it was his first secular, nonsoundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. as described by marsh, it is a masterpiece in which presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. he sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement. the album featured the hit single in the ghetto, issued in april, which reached number three on the pop chartpresleys first nongospel top ten hit since bossa nova baby in . further hit singles were culled from the american sound sessions suspicious minds, dont cry daddy, and kentucky rain.presley was keen to resume regular live performing. following the success of the comeback special, offers came in from around the world. the london palladium offered parker us,  for a oneweek engagement. he responded, thats fine for me, now how much can you get for elvis in may, the brandnew international hotel in las vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced that it had booked presley. he was scheduled to perform fiftyseven shows over four weeks, beginning july . moore, fontana, and the jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in nashville. presley assembled new, topnotch accompaniment, led by guitarist james burton and including two gospel groups, the imperials and sweet inspirations. costume designer bill belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of the comeback special, created a new stage look for presley, inspired by his passion for karate. nonetheless, presley was nervous his only previous las vegas engagement, in , had been dismal. parker, who intended to make presleys return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. for his part, international hotel owner kirk kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to new york to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.presley took to the stage without introduction. the audience of ,, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. a third followed his encore, cant help falling in love . at a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as the king, presley gestured toward fats domino, who was taking in the scene. no, presley said, thats the real king of rock and roll. the next day, parkers negotiations with the hotel resulted in a fiveyear contract for presley to play each february and august, at an annual salary of  million. newsweek commented, there are several unbelievable things about elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars. rolling stone called presley supernatural, his own resurrection. in november, presleys final nonconcert film, change of habit, opened. the double album from memphis to vegas/from vegas to memphis came out the same month; the first lp consisted of live performances from the international, the second of more cuts from the american sound sessions. suspicious minds reached the top of the chartspresleys first u.s. pop numberone in over seven years, and his last.cassandra peterson, later televisions elvira, met presley during this period in las vegas, where she was working as a showgirl. she recalled of their encounter, he was so antidrug when i met him. i mentioned to him that i smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. he said, dont ever do that again. presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.

presley returned to the international early in  for the first of the years twomonthlong engagements, performing two shows a night. recordings from these shows were issued on the album on stage. in late february, presley performed six attendancerecordbreaking shows at the houston astrodome. in april, the single the wonder of you was issueda number one hit in the uk, it topped the u.s. adult contemporary chart, as well. metrogoldwynmayer  filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the international during august for the documentary elvis thats the way it is. presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. during this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless us,  was paid. presley had been the target of many threats since the s, often without his knowledge. the fbi took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. presley went onstage with a derringer in his right boot and a . caliber pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.the album thats the way it is, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. as music historian john robertson noted, the authority of presleys singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the americanroots inspiration of the memphis sessions towards a more middleoftheroad sound. with country put on the back burner, and soul and rb left in memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white popperfect for the las vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for elvis. after the end of his international engagement on september , presley embarked on a weeklong concert tour, largely of the south, his first since . another weeklong tour, of the west coast, followed in november.

on december , , presley engineered a meeting with u.s. president richard nixon at the white house, where he expressed his patriotism and explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred. he asked nixon for a bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he retain his credibility. presley told nixon that the beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of antiamericanism. presley and his friends previously had a fourhour gettogether with the beatles at his home in bel air, california, in august . on hearing reports of the meeting, paul mccartney later said that he felt a bit betrayed. ... the great joke was that we were taking illegal drugs, and look what happened to him, a reference to presleys early death linked to prescription drug abuse.  later elvis would call the white house to speak with president jimmy carter to request a presidential pardon for a friend who had not yet been tried.the u.s. junior chamber of commerce named presley one of its annual ten most outstanding young men of the nation on january , . not long after, the city of memphis named the stretch of highway  south on which graceland is located elvis presley boulevard. the same year, presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the lifetime achievement award  by the national academy of recording arts and sciences, the grammy award organization. three new, nonfilm presley studio albums were released in , as many as had come out over the previous eight years. best received by critics was elvis country, a concept record that focused on genre standards. the biggest seller was elvis sings the wonderful world of christmas, the truest statement of all, according to greil marcus. in the midst of ten painfully genteel christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find elvis tomcatting his way through six blazing minutes of merry christmas baby, a raunchy old charles brown blues. ... if presleys sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.

mgm again filmed presley in april , this time for elvis on tour, which went on to win the golden globe award for best documentary film for that years golden globe awards. his gospel album he touched me, released that month, would earn him his second grammy award for best inspirational performance, for that years grammy awards. a fourteendate tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive soldout shows at new yorks madison square garden. the evening concert on july  was recorded and issued in an lp form a week later. elvis as recorded at madison square garden became one of presleys biggestselling albums. after the tour, the single burning love was releasedpresleys last top ten hit on the u.s. pop chart. the most exciting single elvis has made since all shook up, wrote rock critic robert christgau. who else could make its coming closer, the flames are now licking my body sound like an assignation with james browns backup band

presley and his wife, meanwhile, had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. in , an affair he had with joyce bova resultedunbeknownst to himin her pregnancy and an abortion. he often raised the possibility of joyce moving into graceland, saying that he was likely to leave priscilla. the presleys separated on february , , after priscilla disclosed her relationship with mike stone, a karate instructor presley had recommended to her. priscilla related that when she told him, presley raped her, declaring, this is how a real man makes love to his woman. she later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement. five months later, presleys new girlfriend, linda thompson, a songwriter and onetime memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. presley and his wife filed for divorce on august . according to joe moscheo of the imperials, the failure of presleys marriage was a blow from which he never recovered. at a rare press conference that june, a reporter had asked presley whether he was satisfied with his image. presley replied, well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... its very hard to live up to an image.in january , presley performed two benefit concerts for the kui lee cancer fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, aloha from hawaii, which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. the first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. on january , aloha from hawaii aired live via satellite to primetime audiences in japan, south korea, thailand, the philippines, australia, and new zealand, as well as to u.s. servicemen based across southeast asia. in japan, where it capped a nationwide elvis presley week, it smashed viewing records. the next night, it was simulcast to twentyeight european countries, and in april an extended version finally aired in the u.s., where it won a fiftyseven percent share of the tv audience. over time, parkers claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted, but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention. presleys stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latterday persona became closely associated. as described by bobbie ann mason, at the end of the show, when he spreads out his american eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god figure. the accompanying double album, released in february, went to number one and eventually sold over  million copies in the u.s. it was presleys last u.s. numberone pop album during his lifetime.at a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. security personnel came to presleys defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. following the show, presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by mike stone, priscillas lover, to kill him. though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, presley raged, theres too much pain in me ... stone must die. his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. after another two full days of raging, red west, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when presley decided, aw hell, lets just leave it for now. maybe its a bit heavy.

presleys divorce was finalized on october , . by then, his health was in serious decline. twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. towards the end of , he was hospitalized, semicomatose from the effects of a pethidine addiction. according to his primary care physician, george c. nichopoulos, presley felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasnt the common everyday junkie getting something off the street. since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and  saw  concerts, his busiest schedule ever. despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in .presleys condition declined precipitously that september. keyboardist tony brown remembered his arrival at a university of maryland concert he fell out of the limousine, to his knees. people jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, dont help me. he walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. everybodys looking at each other like, is the tour gonna happen guitarist john wilkinson recalled, he was all gut. he was slurring. he was so fucked up. ... it was obvious he was drugged. it was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. it was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... i remember crying. he could barely get through the introductions.rca, which had always enjoyed a steady stream of product from presley, began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. after a session in december  that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, presley made no official studio recordings in . parker delivered rca another concert record, elvis recorded live on stage in memphis. recorded on march , it included a version of how great thou art that won presley his third and final grammy award for best inspirational performance at that years grammy awards. all three of his competitive grammy wins  out of fourteen total nominations  were for gospel recordings. presley returned to the recording studio in hollywood in march , but parkers attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful. in , rca sent a mobile recording unit to graceland that made possible two fullscale recording sessions at presleys home. however, the recording process had become a struggle for him.

journalist tony scherman wrote that, by early , presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts. according to andy greene of rolling stone, presleys final performances were mostly sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch. in alexandria, louisiana, he was on stage for less than an hour and was impossible to understand. on march , he canceled a performance in baton rouge, unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. according to guralnick, fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books. presleys cousin, billy smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite monty python sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded smith of the billionaire recluse howard hughes.way down, presleys last single issued during his lifetime, was released on june , . that month, cbs taped two concerts for a television special, elvis in concert, to be broadcast in october. in the first, shot in omaha on june , presleys voice, guralnick writes, is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project. two days later, in rapid city, south dakota, he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too, though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was framed in a helmet of blueblack hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks. presleys final concert was held in indianapolis at market square arena, on june , .

on august , , presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of memphis to portland, maine, to begin another tour. that afternoon, however, his fiancée ginger alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on the bathroom floor of his graceland mansion. biographer joel williamson suggests that involving a reaction to the codeine he had taken and attempts to move his bowelshe experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. alarmed, he stood up ... and fell face down in the fetal position. drooling on the rug and unable to breathe, he died. attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at baptist memorial hospital at  p.m. he was  years old.president jimmy carter issued a statement that credited presley with having permanently changed the face of american popular culture. thousands of people gathered outside graceland to view the open casket. one of presleys cousins, billy mann, accepted us,  to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the national enquirers biggestselling issue ever. alden struck a ,  deal with the enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. presley left her nothing in his will.presleys funeral was held at graceland on thursday, august . outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third. about , people lined the processional route to forest hill cemetery, where presley was buried next to his mother. within a few weeks, way down topped the country and uk singles chart. following an attempt to steal presleys body in late august, the remains of both presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in gracelands meditation garden on october . presley is buried alongside his parents, daughter, grandson and his paternal grandmother in the meditation garden at graceland.

while an autopsy, undertaken the same day presley died, was still in progress, memphis medical examiner jerry francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest. asked if drugs were involved, he declared that drugs played no role in presleys death. in fact, drug use was heavily implicated in presleys death, writes guralnick. the pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy. a pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death; one reported fourteen drugs in elvis system, ten in significant quantity. in , forensic pathologist cyril wecht conducted a review of the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in presleys accidental death. forensic historian and pathologist michael baden viewed the situation as complicated elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time. that, together with his drug habit, caused his death. but he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.the competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive; and denied drugs played any part in presleys death before the toxicology results were known. allegations of a coverup were widespread. while a  trial of presleys main physician, george c. nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability for his death, the facts were startling in the first eight months of  alone, he had prescribed more than , doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics all in elvis name. nichopoulos license was suspended for three months. it was permanently revoked in the s after the tennessee medical board brought new charges of overprescription.in , the presley autopsy report was reopened. joseph davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as miamidade county coroner, declared at its completion, there is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. in fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack. more recent research has revealed that francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. other staff could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. that would be a matter of weeks. one of the examiners, e. eric muirhead, could not believe his ears. francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospitals team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed that elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. as they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. they had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments. according to biographer frank coffey and dan warlick, one of the physicians who were present at the autopsy, presleys death was caused by a valsalva maneuver due to constipation as a result of drug abuse. when using the toilet, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singers abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart.

between  and , six of presleys posthumously released singles were topten country hits. graceland was opened to the public in . attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the secondmostvisited home in the united states, after the white house. the residence was declared a national historic landmark in .presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame the rock and roll hall of fame , the country music hall of fame , the gospel music hall of fame , the rockabilly hall of fame , and the memphis music hall of fame . in , he received the w. c. handy award from the blues foundation and the academy of country musics first golden hat award. in , he received the american music awards award of merit.a junkie xl remix of presleys a little less conversation  was used in a nike advertising campaign during the  fifa world cup. it topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of presleys numberone hits, elvs, which was also an international success. the album returned presley to the top of the billboard chart for the first time in almost three decades.in , a remix of rubberneckin, a  recording of presleys, topped the u.s. sales chart, as did a thanniversary rerelease of thats all right the following year. the latter was an outright hit in britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in canada. in , another three reissued singles, jailhouse rock, one night/i got stung, and its now or never, went to number one in the uk. they were part of a campaign that saw the rerelease of all eighteen of presleys previous charttopping uk singles. the first, all shook up, came with a collectors box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the british top five.in , forbes magazine named presley the topearning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of  million. he was placed second in , returned to the top spot the next two years, and ranked fourth in . the following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever millionspurred by the celebration of his th birthday and the launch of cirque du soleils viva elvis show in las vegas. in november , viva elvis the album was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks. as of mid, there were an estimated , licensed presley products, and he was again the secondhighestearning deceased celebrity. six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of  million, up  million from  due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, elvis presleys memphis, and hotel, the guest house at graceland.in , rca/legacy released elvis presley  where no one stands alone, a new album focused on elvis love of gospel music. produced by joel weinshanker, lisa marie presley and andy childs, the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with elvis. it also included a reimagined duet with lisa marie, on the albums title track.in , baz luhrmanns film elvis, a biographical film about presleys life, was released in theaters. presley is portrayed by austin butler and parker by tom hanks. as of august , the film had grossed . million worldwide on a  million budget, becoming the secondhighestgrossing music biopic of alltime behind bohemian rhapsody , and the fifthhighestgrossing australianproduced film. for his portrayal of elvis, butler won the golden globe and was nominated for the oscar for best actor. in january , on what would have been presleys th birthday, his  lockheed  jetstar sold at an auction for ,. the plane sold at the mecum kissimmee collector car auction in florida.

presleys earliest musical influence came from gospel. his mother recalled that from the age of two, at the assembly of god church in tupelo attended by the family, he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. there he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them. in memphis, presley frequently attended allnight gospel singings at the ellis auditorium, where groups such as the statesmen quartet led the music in a style that, guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of presleys future stage act

the statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of lanskys. ... bass singer jim wetherington, known universally as the big chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. he went about as far as you could go in gospel music, said jake hess. the women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows. preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.

as a teenager, presleys musical interests were wideranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and africanamerican musical idioms. though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged  in . when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as stoller put it, he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music. at a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, i know practically every religious song thats ever been written.

presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was  years old. he could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear. presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his sun recordings and his s rca albums. he played electric bass guitar on  baby i dont care after his bassist bill black had trouble with the instrument. presley played the bass line including the intro. presley played piano on songs such as old shep and first in line from his  album elvis. he is credited with playing piano on later albums such as from elvis in memphis and moody blue, and on unchained melody, which was one of the last songs that he recorded. presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called are you lonesome tonight. in the  comeback special, elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as baby what you want me to do and one night. presley played the back of his guitar on some of his hits such as all shook up, dont be cruel, and  teddy bear, providing percussion by slapping the instrument to create a beat. the album elvis is back features presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as i will be home again and like a baby.

presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in  with elvis presleys first release, on the sun label, writes craig morrison. paul friedlander described rockabilly as essentially ... an elvis presley construction, with the defining elements as the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling of the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar of country. in thats all right, the presley trios first record, scotty moores guitar solo, a combination of merle travisstyle country fingerpicking, doublestop slides from acoustic boogie, and bluesbased bentnote, singlestring work, is a microcosm of this fusion. while katherine charlton calls presley rockabillys originator, carl perkins, another pioneer of rocknroll, said that sam phillips, elvis, and i didnt create rockabilly. according to michael campbell, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by bill haley. in moores view, it had been there for quite a while, really. carl perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around jackson, and i know for a fact jerry lee lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.at rca victor, presleys rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher, more intense manner. while he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard blue moon at sun records to the country ballad hows the world treating you on his second rca victor lp to the blues of santa claus is back in town. in , his first gospel record was released, the foursong ep peace in the valley. certified as a millionseller, it became the topselling gospel ep in recording history. presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.

after his return from military service in , presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. his first postarmy single, the numberone hit stuck on you, is typical of this shift. rca victor publicity referred to its mild rock beat; discographer ernst jorgensen calls it upbeat pop. the number five shes not you  integrates the jordanaires so completely, its practically doowop. the modern blues/rb sound captured with success on elvis is back was essentially abandoned for six years until such  recordings as down in the alley and hiheel sneakers. presleys output during most of the s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as are you lonesome tonight, a numberone in . its now or never, which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the neapolitan song o sole mio and concluding with a fullvoiced operatic cadence. these were both dramatic numbers, but most of what presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.while presley performed several of his classic ballads for the  comeback special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. he recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become hard to find. a significant exception was burning love, his last major hit on the pop charts. like his work of the s, presleys subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. much of elvis in memphis, as well as suspicious minds, cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. in the mids, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.

the developmental arc of presleys singing voice, as described by critic dave marsh, goes from high and thrilled in the early days, to lower and perplexed in the final months. marsh credits presley with the introduction of the vocal stutter on s baby lets play house. when on dont be cruel, presley slides into a mmmmm that marks the transition between the first two verses, he shows how masterful his relaxed style really is. marsh describes the vocal performance on cant help falling in love as one of gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing, with the line shall i stay pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal.jorgensen calls the  recording of how great thou art an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions, as presley crafted for himself an adhoc arrangement in which he took every part of the fourpart vocal, from the bass intro to the soaring heights of the songs operatic climax, becoming a kind of oneman quartet. guralnick finds stand by me from the same gospel sessions a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance, but, by contrast, feels that presley reaches beyond his powers on where no one stands alone, resorting to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound that jake hess of the statesmen quartet had in his command. hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of presleys, he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime. guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something the warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.marsh praises his  reading of u.s. male, bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his sun records. the performance on in the ghetto is, according to jorgensen, devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms, instead relying on the exceptional clarity and sensitivity of his voice. guralnick describes the songs delivery as of almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity. on suspicious minds, guralnick hears essentially the same remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise, but supplemented with an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism  and anguish .music critic henry pleasants observes that presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. an extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion. he identifies presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, from the baritone low g to the tenor high b, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a dflat. presleys best octave is in the middle, dflat to dflat, granting an extra full step up or down. in pleasants view, his voice was variable and unpredictable at the bottom, often brilliant at the top, with the capacity for fullvoiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy. scholar lindsay waters, who figures presleys range as twoandaquarter octaves, emphasizes that his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. his voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all. presley was always able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythmandblues and gospel singers, writes pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.

when dewey phillips first aired thats all right on memphis whbq, many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black. from the beginning of his national fame, presley expressed respect for africanamerican performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the south. interviewed in , he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician arthur crudupthe originator of thats all rightbang his box the way i do now, and i said if i ever got to the place where i could feel all old arthur felt, id be a music man like nobody ever saw. the memphis world, an africanamerican newspaper, reported that presley, the rock n roll phenomenon, cracked memphis segregation laws by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its colored night. such statements and actions led presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. in contrast, many white adults did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. antinegro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. regardless of whether parents were aware of the negro sexual origins of the phrase rock n roll, presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.despite the largely positive view of presley held by african americans, a rumor spread in mid that he had at some point announced, the only thing negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes. a journalist with the national african american weekly jet, louie robinson, pursued the story. on the set of jailhouse rock, presley granted robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. he denied making such a statement i never said anything like that, and people who know me know that i wouldnt have said it. ... a lot of people seem to think i started this business. but rock n roll was here a long time before i came along. nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. lets face it i cant sing like fats domino can. i know that. robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that presley was anything but racist. blues singer ivory joe hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited graceland one evening, reported of presley, he showed me every courtesy, and i think hes one of the greatest. though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against presley decades later.the persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to africanamerican sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. into the st century, the notion that presley had stolen black music still found adherents. notable among africanamerican entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson, who argued, a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis. moreover, presley also acknowledged his debt to africanamerican musicians throughout his career. addressing his  comeback special audience, he said, rock n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. people have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to that. nine years earlier, he had said, rock n roll has been around for many years. it used to be called rhythm and blues.

presleys physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. he was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful, according to critic mark feeney. television director steve binder, no fan of presleys music before he oversaw the  comeback special, reported, im straight as an arrow and i got to tell you, you stop, whether youre male or female, to look at him. he was that good looking. and if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldnt make any difference; if hed walked in the room, youd know somebody special was in your presence. his performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for presleys eroticized image. writing in , critic george melly described him as the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl. in his presley obituary, lester bangs credited him as the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in america. ed sullivans declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in presleys trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.while presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. in , sight and sounds peter john dyer described his onscreen persona as aggressively bisexual in appeal. brett farmer places the orgasmic gyrations of the title dance sequence in jailhouse rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image. in the analysis of yvonne tasker, elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white workingclass masculinity as aggressive sexual display.reinforcing presleys image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various hollywood stars and starlets, from natalie wood in the s to connie stevens and annmargret in the s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in the s. june juanico of memphis, one of presleys early girlfriends, later blamed parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. presley never grew comfortable with the hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.

presley kept several horses at graceland, initially because of priscilla presley. he got me my first horse as a christmas present  domino, said priscilla. the horse named palomino rising sun was presley favorite horse, and there are many photographs of presley riding him.

presleys rise to national attention in  transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. as the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. with its racially mixed originsrepeatedly affirmed by presleyrock and rolls occupation of a central position in mainstream american culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.in this regard, little richard said of presley, he was an integrator. elvis was a blessing. they wouldnt let black music through. he opened the door for black music. al green agreed he broke the ice for all of us.president jimmy carter remarked on presleys legacy in  his music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of american popular culture. his following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country. presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication at the age of , within a year of his first appearance on american network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.

presleys name, image, and voice are recognized around the world. he has inspired a legion of impersonators. in polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential americans. american composer and conductor leonard bernstein said, elvis presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. he introduced the beat to everything and he changed everythingmusic, language, clothes. its a whole new social revolutionthe sixties came from it. john lennon said that nothing really affected me until elvis. bob dylan described the sensation of first hearing presley as like busting out of jail.

for much of his adult life, presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the american dream. in his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony. increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chickenfried steak and biscuits and gravy. in particular, his love of fried peanut butter, banana, and  bacon sandwiches, now known as elvis sandwiches, came to symbolize this characteristic. according to the media scholar robert thompson, the sandwich also signified presleys enduring allamerican appeal he wasnt only the king, he was one of us.since , there have been numerous alleged sightings of presley. a longstanding conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death. adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace. an unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly. every august , the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside graceland and celebrate his memory with a candlelight ritual. with elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death, writes ted harrison. he himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. it is as if he has been canonized by acclamation.on the th anniversary of presleys death, the new york times asserted, all the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. but before elvis was camp, he was its opposite a genuine cultural force. ... elvis breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rockandroll age, his hardrocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely. not only presleys achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by greil marcus

elvis presley is a supreme figure in american life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... the cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great american.

films generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. however, theatrical boxoffice earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. included on the list are charts of the top boxoffice earners , a chart of highgrossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highestgrossing film record, and a chart of the highestgrossing film franchises and series. all charts are ranked by international theatrical boxoffice performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.

traditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the st century. there is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the marvel cinematic universe featuring among the nominal topearners. the most successful superhero film, avengers endgame, is also the secondhighestgrossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the avengers comic books charting in the top twenty. other marvel comics adaptations have also had success with the spiderman and xmen properties, while films based on batman and superman from dc comics have generally performed well. star wars is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the jurassic park franchise features prominently. although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from preexisting properties and sequels, it is headed by avatar, which is an original work. animated family films have performed consistently well, with disney films enjoying lucrative rereleases prior to the homevideo era. disney also enjoyed later success with films such as frozen and frozen ii, zootopia, and the lion king , as well as its pixar brand, of which incredibles , toy story  and , and finding dory have been the best performers. beyond disney and pixar animation, the despicable me, shrek, and ice age series have met with the most success.

while inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the s, s, and s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. besides the star wars and superman franchises, james bond and godzilla films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highestgrossing franchises. some of the older films that held the record of highestgrossing film still have respectable grosses by todays standards, but no longer compete numerically against todays topearners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. when those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then gone with the windwhich was the highestgrossing film outright for twentyfive yearsis still the highestgrossing film of all time. all grosses on the list are expressed in u.s. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.

with a worldwide boxoffice gross of over . billion, avatar is proclaimed to be the highestgrossing film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a films earnings. once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. titanic earned . billion from video and dvd sales and rentals, in addition to the . billion it grossed in theatres. while complete sales data are not available for avatar, it earned  million from the sale of sixteen million dvd and bluray units in north america, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million dvd and bluray units worldwide. after home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over  billion each. television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a films earnings, with a film often earning the equivalent of as much as  of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top of payperview revenues; titanic earned a further  million from the nbc and hbo broadcast rights, equating to about  of its north american gross.

when a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. the lion king  earned over  billion in boxoffice and home video sales, but this pales in comparison to the  billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. merchandising can be extremely lucrative too the lion king also sold  billion of merchandise, while pixars carswhich earned  million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other pixar filmsgenerated global merchandise sales of over  billion in the five years after its  release. pixar had another huge hit with toy story , which generated almost  billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the  billion it earned at the box office.on this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. six films in total have grossed in excess of  billion worldwide, with avatar ranked in the top position. all of the films have had a theatrical run  in the st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticketprice inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.

because of the longterm effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. the unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. to compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. for example, in , tickets cost . or about . in inflationadjusted  dollars; by , prices had risen to about ., a drop to . in inflationadjusted  dollars. ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.another complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. one notable example of this phenomenon is avatar, which was also released in d and imax almost twothirds of tickets for that film were for d showings with an average price of , and about onesixth were for imax showings with an average price over ., compared to a  average price of . for d films. social and economic factors such as population change and the growth of international markets also have an effect on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted childrens tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.the measuring system for gauging a films success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry the boxoffice receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. as the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a top film of all time, so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. gone with the windfirst released in is generally considered to be the most successful film, with guinness world records in  estimating its adjusted global gross at . billion. estimates for gone with the winds adjusted gross have varied substantially its owner, turner entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at . billion in , a few years earlier than the guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under  billion in , while another provided an alternative figure of . billion in . which film is gone with the winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used guinness had avatar in second place with  billion, while other estimates saw titanic in the runnerup spot with firstrun worldwide earnings of almost . billion at  prices.

audience tastes were fairly eclectic during the th century, but several trends did emerge. during the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with the birth of a nation , the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the big parade and wings  becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with all quiet on the western front in . with the advent of sound in , the musicalthe genre best placed to showcase the new technologytook over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with  and  both being topped by musical films. the genre continued to perform strongly in the s, but the outbreak of world war ii saw warthemed films dominate again during this period, starting with gone with the wind  in , and finishing with the best years of our lives  in . samson and delilah  saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during ancient rome/biblical times throughout the s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with quo vadis, the robe, the ten commandments, benhur and spartacus all becoming the highestgrossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several highprofile failures. the success of white christmas and south pacific in the s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the s with west side story, mary poppins, my fair lady, the sound of music and funny girl all among the top films of the decade. the s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either george lucas or steven spielberg topping the chart during the s. the st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the boxoffice dominance of films based on preexisting intellectual property at record levels.

steven spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in , , , ,  and . cecil b. demille  is in second place with five films and william wyler  and james cameron  are tied for third place with four films. d. w. griffith , george roy hill  and the russo brothers  all feature heavily with three films apiece. george lucas directed two charttoppers in  and , but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in , , ,  and  as well. the following directors have also all directed two films on the chart frank lloyd, king vidor, frank capra, michael curtiz, leo mccarey, alfred hitchcock, david lean, stanley kubrick, guy hamilton, mike nichols, william friedkin, peter jackson, gore verbinski, and michael bay; mervyn leroy, ken annakin and robert wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and john ford codirected two films. disney films are usually codirected and some directors have served on several winning teams wilfred jackson, hamilton luske, clyde geronimi, david hand, ben sharpsteen, wolfgang reitherman and bill roberts have all codirected at least two films on the list. only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years mccarey , nichols , spielberg , jackson , verbinski  and the russo brothers .

because of release schedulesespecially in the case of films released towards the end of the yearand different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being rereleased periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a films firstrun gross is included in brackets after the total if known. because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. in the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being rereleased the previous recordholder is also retained.

at least eleven films have held the record of highestgrossing film since the birth of a nation assumed the top spot in . both the birth of a nation and gone with the wind spent twentyfive consecutive years apiece as the highestgrosser, with films directed by steven spielberg and james cameron holding the record on three occasions each. spielberg became the first director to break his own record when jurassic park overtook e.t., and cameron emulated the feat when avatar broke the record set by titanic. when it took over the top spot in , avengers endgame became the first sequel to hold the record of highestgrossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirtysix years of spielberg/cameron dominance before avatar reclaimed the top spot two years later in  upon a rerelease.

some sources claim that the big parade superseded the birth of a nation as highestgrossing film, eventually being replaced by snow white and the seven dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by gone with the wind. exact figures are not known for the birth of a nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at . million as of . its international release was delayed by world war i, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the s; coupled with further rereleases in the united states, its  million earnings as reported by variety in  are consistent with the earlier figure. at this time, variety still had the birth of a nation ahead of the big parade  on distributor rentals andif its estimate is correctsnow white and the seven dwarfs  would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although it would have been the highestgrossing talkie, displacing the singing fool . although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely the birth of a nation was ever overtaken by a silentera film, the record would fall to s benhur  if the birth of a nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. in addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, the birth of a nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. it was hugely popular with the ku klux klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around  million. despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. while it is generally accepted that gone with the wind took over the record of highestgrossing film on its initial releasewhich is true in terms of public exhibitionit is likely it did not overtake the birth of a nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the s. gone with the wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by the ten commandments , which closed at the end of  with worldwide rentals of  million compared to gone with the winds  million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was shortlived, since gone with the wind was rereleased the following year and increased its earnings to  million. depending on how accurate the estimates are, the  remake of benhur may also have captured the record from gone with the wind as of the end of  it had earned  million worldwide, and by  it was trailing gone with the wind by just  million with international takings of  million, ultimately earning  million from its initial release.

another film purported to have been the highestgrosser is the  pornographic film deep throat. in , linda lovelace testified to a united states senate judiciary subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned  million; this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than star wars, and finished the s as the highestgrossing film. the main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in about four years into the films releaseshowed the film had grossed over  million. roger ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as  million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the boxoffice receipts for the film.the birth of a nation, gone with the wind, the godfather, jaws, star wars, e.t., and avatar all increased their record grosses with rereleases. the grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from rereleases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for the birth of a nation includes income from its reissues up to ; the total for star wars includes revenue from the late s and early s reissues but not from the  special edition; the total for e.t. incorporates its gross from the  reissue but not from . the total for avatars first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the  special edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a  rerelease in the asiapacific region as well as the  rerelease in china which helped it to reclaim the record. gone with the wind is likewise represented twice on the chart the  entry includes earnings from its staggered  release  along with all of its revenue up to the  reissue prior to losing the record to the sound of music in ; its  entryafter it took back the recordincludes income from the  and  reissues but omitting later releases. the godfather was rereleased in  after its success at the th academy awards, and jaws was released again in , and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. the sound of music, the godfather, jaws, jurassic park, and titanic increased their earnings with further releases in , , , , and , respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being rereleased.

prior to , only seven film series had grossed over  billion at the box office james bond, star wars, indiana jones, rocky, batman, jurassic park, and star trek. since the turn of the century, that number has increased to over ninety . this is partly due to inflation and market growth, but it is also due to hollywoods adoption of the franchise model films that have builtin brand recognition such as being based on a wellknown literary source or an established character. the methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as presold films within the industry.a franchise is typically defined to be at least two works derived from a common intellectual property. traditionally, the work has a tautological relationship with the property, but this is not a prerequisite. an enduring staple of the franchise model is the concept of the crossover, which can be defined as a story in which characters or concepts from two or more discrete texts or series of texts meet. a consequence of a crossover is that an intellectual property may be utilized by more than one franchise. for example, batman v superman dawn of justice belongs to not only the batman and superman franchises, but also to the dc extended universe, which is a shared universe. a shared universe is a particular type of crossover where a number of characters from a wide range of fictional works wind up sharing a fictional world. the most successful shared universe in the medium of film is the marvel cinematic universe, a crossover between multiple superhero properties owned by marvel comics. the marvel cinematic universe is also the highestgrossing franchise, amassing over  billion at the box office.

the spiderman films are the highestgrossing series based on a single property, earning over . billion at the box office . if ancillary income from merchandise is included, then star wars is the most lucrative property; it holds the guinness world record for the most successful film merchandising franchise and was valued at . billion  in . the marvel cinematic universe has had the most films gross over  billion, with ten. the four avengers films, the two frozen films, and the two avatar films are the only franchises where each installment has grossed over  billion, although the jurassic park and black panther series  have averaged over  billion per film.

singapore , officially the republic of singapore, is an island country and citystate in maritime southeast asia. it is located about one degree of latitude  north of the equator, off the southern tip of the malay peninsula, bordering the strait of malacca to the west, the singapore strait to the south, the south china sea to the east, and the straits of johor to the north. the countrys territory comprises one main island,  satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately  since the countrys independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. it has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. with a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, singapore has four official languages english, malay, mandarin, and tamil. english is the lingua franca, with its exclusive use in numerous public services. multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.

singapores history dates back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime emporium known as temasek and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. its contemporary era began in , when stamford raffles established singapore as an entrepôt trading post of the british empire. in , the colonies in southeast asia were reorganised, and singapore came under the direct control of britain as part of the straits settlements. during world war ii, singapore was occupied by japan in  and returned to british control as a separate crown colony following japans surrender in . singapore gained selfgovernance in  and, in , became part of the new federation of malaysia, alongside malaya, north borneo, and sarawak. ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian malaysian malaysia political ideology led by lee kuan yew into the other constituent entities of malaysiaat the perceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of ketuanan melayueventually led to singapores expulsion from the federation two years later; singapore became an independent sovereign country in .

after early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the four asian tigers. with its growth based on international trade and economic globalisation, it integrated itself with the world economy through free trade with minimaltono trade barriers or tariffs, exportoriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. as a highly developed country, it has the highest gdp per capita  in the world. identified as a tax haven, singapore is the only country in asia with a aaa sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. it is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. singapore ranks highly in key social indicators education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a homeownership rate of  percent. singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world.

singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. while the country is a multiparty democracy with free elections, the government under the peoples action party  wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. the pap has governed the country continuously since full internal selfgovernment was achieved in , currently holding  out of  elected seats in parliament. one of the five founding members of asean, singapore is also the headquarters of the asiapacific economic cooperation secretariat, the pacific economic cooperation council secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. singapore is also a member of the united nations, the world trade organization, the east asia summit, the nonaligned movement, and the commonwealth of nations.

the english name of singapore is an anglicisation of the native malay name for the country, singapura , which was in turn derived from the sanskrit word for lion city . pulau ujong was one of the earliest references to singapore island, which corresponds to a chinese account from the third century referred to a place as pú luó zhōng , a transcription of the malay name for island at the end of a peninsula. early references to the name temasek  are found in the nagarakretagama, a javanese eulogy written in , and a vietnamese source from the same time period. the name possibly means sea town, being derived from the malay tasek, meaning sea or lake. the chinese traveller wang dayuan visited a place around  named danmaxi  or tam ma siak, depending on pronunciation; this may be a transcription of temasek, alternatively, it may be a combination of the malay tanah meaning land and chinese xi meaning tin, which was traded on the island.variations of the name siṃhapura were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the kingdom of singapura. in hindubuddhist culture, lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name. the name singapura supplanted temasek sometime before the th century, after the establishment of the kingdom of singapura on the island by a fleeing sumatran raja  from palembang. however, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. the semihistorical malay annals state that temasek was christened singapura by sang nila utama, a thcentury sumatran raja from palembang. the annals state that sang nila utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. seeing this as an omen, he established the town of singapura where he encountered the beast., the second hypothesis, drawn from portuguese sources, postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life parameswara of palembang. parameswara declared independence from majapahit and mounted a lion throne. after then being driven into exile by the javanese, he usurped control over temasek. it is possible that he rechristened the area as singapura, recalling the throne he had been driven from.under japanese occupation, singapore was renamed syonan , meaning light of the south. singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the garden city, in reference to its parks and treelined streets. another informal name, the little red dot, was adopted after an article in the asian wall street journal of  august  said that indonesian president b. j. habibie referred to singapore as a red dot on a map.

in , according to the malay annals, the kingdom of singapura was founded on the island by sang nila utama. although the historicity of the accounts as given in the malay annals is the subject of academic debates, it is nevertheless known from various documents that singapore in the th century, then known as temasek, was a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the siamese kingdoms, and was a part of the indosphere. these indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability. historical sources also indicate that around the end of the th century, its ruler parameswara was attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese, forcing him to move to malacca where he founded the sultanate of malacca. archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time afterwards. in , portuguese raiders burned down the settlement, and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries. by then, singapore was nominally part of the johor sultanate. the wider maritime region and much trade was under dutch control for the following period after the dutch conquest of malacca.

the british governor stamford raffles arrived in singapore on  january  and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. the island was then nominally ruled by tengku abdul rahman, the sultan of johor, who was controlled by the dutch and the bugis. however, the sultanate was weakened by factional division abdul rahman, the temenggong of johor to tengku abdul rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the sultans elder brother tengku long, who was living in exile in penyengat island, riau islands. with the temenggongs help, raffles managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore. raffles offered to recognise tengku long as the rightful sultan of johor, under the title of sultan hussein, as well as provide him with a yearly payment of  and another  to the temenggong; in return, sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on singapore. the treaty of singapore was signed on  february .

in , a further treaty with the sultan led to the entire island becoming a british possession. in , singapore became part of the straits settlements, then under the jurisdiction of british india. singapore became the regional capital in . prior to raffles arrival, there were only about a thousand people living on the island, mostly indigenous malays along with a handful of chinese. by  the population had swelled to over ,, more than half being chinese. many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations. in , the straits settlements were separated from british india, coming under the direct control of britain. later, in the s, when the rubber industry became established in malaya and singapore, the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export.

singapore was not greatly affected by the first world war , as the conflict did not spread to southeast asia. the only significant event during the war was the  singapore mutiny by muslim sepoys from british india, who were garrisoned in singapore. after hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight the ottoman empire, a muslim state, the soldiers rebelled, killing their officers and several british civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by nonmuslim troops arriving from johore and burma.after world war i, the british built the large singapore naval base as part of the defensive singapore strategy. originally announced in , the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the japanese invasion of manchuria in . costing  million and not fully completed in , it was nonetheless the largest dry dock in the world, the thirdlargest floating dock, and had enough fuel tanks to support the entire british navy for six months. the base was defended by heavy inch  naval guns stationed at fort siloso, fort canning and labrador, as well as a royal air force airfield at tengah air base. winston churchill touted it as the gibraltar of the east, and military discussions often referred to the base as simply east of suez. however, the british home fleet was stationed in europe, and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in asia. the plan was for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency. as a consequence, after world war ii broke out in , the fleet was fully occupied with defending britain, leaving singapore vulnerable to japanese invasion.

during the pacific war, the japanese invasion of malaya culminated in the battle of singapore. when the british force of , troops surrendered on  february , british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british history. british and empire losses during the fighting for singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly , personnel captured. about , were killed or wounded, of which australians made up the majority. japanese casualties during the fighting in singapore amounted to , killed and , wounded. the occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations, including those of japan, britain, and singapore. japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war. between , and , ethnic chinese people were killed in the subsequent sook ching massacre. british forces had planned to liberate singapore in ; however, the war ended before these operations could be carried out.

after the japanese surrender to the allies on  august , singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revengekilling were widespread. british, australian, and indian troops led by lord louis mountbatten returned to singapore to receive the formal surrender of japanese forces in the region from general seishirō itagaki on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on  september . meanwhile, tomoyuki yamashita was tried by a us military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in malaya or singapore. he was convicted and hanged in the philippines on  february .much of singapores infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. a shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. a series of strikes in  caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. however, by late  the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber. the failure of britain to successfully defend its colony against the japanese changed its image in the eyes of singaporeans. british military administration ended on  april , and singapore became a separate crown colony. in july , separate executive and legislative councils were established and the election of six members of the legislative council was scheduled for the following year.during the s, chinese communists, with strong ties to the trade unions and chinese schools, waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the malayan emergency. the  national service riots, hock lee bus riots, and chinese middle schools riots in singapore were all linked to these events. david marshall, proindependence leader of the labour front, won singapores first general election in . he led a delegation to london, and britain rejected his demand for complete selfrule. he resigned and was replaced by lim yew hock in , and after further negotiations britain agreed to grant singapore full internal selfgovernment for all matters except defence and foreign affairs. during the subsequent may  elections, the peoples action party  won a landslide victory. governor sir william allmond codrington goode served as the first yang dipertuan negara .

pap leaders believed that singapores future lay with malaya, due to strong ties between the two. it was thought that reuniting with malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in singapore. however, a sizeable procommunist wing of the pap was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the barisan sosialis, splitting from the pap. the ruling party of malaya, united malays national organisation , was staunchly anticommunist, and it was suspected umno would support the noncommunist factions of pap. umno, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the pap government and concern that the large ethnic chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance in malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.on  may , malayas prime minister, tunku abdul rahman, made a surprise proposal for a new federation called malaysia, which would unite the current and former british possessions in the region the federation of malaya, singapore, brunei, north borneo, and sarawak. umno leaders believed that the additional malay population in the bornean territories would balance singapores chinese population. the british government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for communism. to obtain a mandate for a merger, the pap held a referendum on the merger. this referendum included a choice of different terms for a merger with malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether. on  september , singapore joined with malaya, the north borneo, and sarawak to form the new federation of malaysia under the terms of the malaysia agreement. under this agreement, singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other states of malaysia.indonesia opposed the formation of malaysia due to its own claims over borneo and launched konfrontasi  in response to the formation of malaysia. on  march , a bomb planted by indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded, killing three people and injuring  others. it was the deadliest of at least  bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation. two members of the indonesian marine corps, osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said, were eventually convicted and executed for the crime. the explosion caused us,  in damages to macdonald house.even after the merger, the singaporean government and the malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues. despite an agreement to establish a common market, singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of malaysia. in retaliation, singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. talks soon broke down, and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. this led to communal strife in singapore, culminating in the  race riots. on  august , malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed  advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia. on  august , the malaysian parliament voted  to  to move a bill to amend the constitution, expelling singapore from malaysia, which left singapore as a newly independent country.

after being expelled from malaysia, singapore became independent as the republic of singapore on  august , with lee kuan yew and yusof bin ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively. in , the country cofounded the association of southeast asian nations . race riots broke out once more in . lee kuan yews emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped singapores policies for the next halfcentury. economic growth continued throughout the s, with the unemployment rate falling to  and real gdp growth averaging at about  up until . during the s, singapore began to shift towards hightech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. singapore changi airport was opened in  and singapore airlines was formed. the port of singapore became one of the worlds busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.the pap has remained in power since independence. some activists and opposition politicians see the governments strict regulation of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights. in response, singapore has seen several significant political changes, such as the introduction of the nonconstituency members of parliament in  to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as mps. group representation constituencies  were introduced in  to create multiseat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. nominated members of parliament were introduced in  to allow nonelected nonpartisan mps. the constitution was amended in  to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of past reserves and appointments to certain public offices.in , goh chok tong succeeded lee and became singapores second prime minister. during gohs tenure, the country went through the  asian financial crisis and the  sars outbreak. in , lee hsien loong, the eldest son of lee kuan yew, became the countrys third prime minister. lee hsien loongs tenure included the  global financial crisis, the resolution of a dispute over land ownership at tanjong pagar railway station between singapore and malaysia, and the introduction of the two integrated resorts , located at the marina bay sands and resorts world sentosa. the pap suffered its worst ever electoral results in , winning just  of votes, amidst debate over issues including the influx of foreign workers and the high cost of living. on  march , lee kuan yew died, and a oneweek period of public mourning was observed nationwide. subsequently, the pap regained its dominance in parliament through the september general election, receiving . of the popular vote, although this remained lower than the  tally of . and the  tally of .. the  election held in july saw the pap drop to  of the vote, while the workers party took  of the  seats, the highest number ever won by another party.

singapore is a parliamentary republic based on the westminster system. the constitution of singapore is the supreme law of the country, establishing the structure and responsibility of governance. the president is the head of state. the governance of singapore is separated into three branches

executive the executive consists of the cabinet, led by the prime minister, and the attorney generals chambers led by the attorneygeneral. the cabinet is collectively responsible for all government policies and the daytoday administration of the affairs of state. it is typically composed of members of the singapore parliament. the prime minister is appointed by the president, and the ministers in the cabinet and the attorneygeneral are appointed by the president, acting on the advice and consent of the prime minister. the prime minister is the effective head of the executive branch of government.legislature the singapore parliament is unicameral and, together with the president, comprises the legislature. members of parliament  consist of elected, nonconstituency, and nominated members. the majority of mps are elected into parliament at a general election. the singapore parliament is collectively responsible for enacting the laws governing the state. the president holds limited discretionary powers of oversight over the government. the presidents veto powers are further subject to parliamentary overruling.judiciary the judiciarys function is to independently administer justice and is headed by the chief justice. the judges and judicial commissioners are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister. the supreme court and state courts adjudicates in civil disputes between persons, convicts or acquits accused persons in criminal prosecutions, and interprets laws to decide on its constitutionality. any law or provision of a law found to be unconstitutional can be struck down by the supreme court.the president is directly elected by popular vote for a renewable sixyear term. requirements for this position, which were enacted by the pap government, are extremely stringent, such that only a handful of people qualify for the candidacy. these qualifications include that a candidate needs to be a person at least  years of age who is no longer a member of a political party, to either have held public office for at least  years in a number of specific public service leadership roles, or to have  years experience as chief executive of a fully profitable private sector company with at least s million in shareholders equity, be a resident in singapore for at least  years, not have a criminal record, and more. candidates must also satisfy the presidential elections committee  that he or she is a person of integrity, good character and reputation.

the constitution requires that presidential elections be reserved for a racial community if no one from that ethnic group has been elected to the presidency in the five most recent terms. only members of that community may qualify as candidates in a reserved presidential election. in the  presidential election, this combination of stringent requirements and a reserved election that required the candidate to be of the  malay ethnic group led to the pec approving a single candidate for the presidency; halimah yacob, considered part of the malay community, won in an uncontested election. she also became singapores first female president.

members of parliament  are elected at least every five years . the th and current parliament has  members;  were directly elected from the  constituencies, nine are nonpartisan nominated members appointed by the president, and three are nonconstituency members from opposition parties who were not elected in the last general election but appointed to the legislature to increase opposition party representation. in group representation constituencies , political parties assemble teams of candidates to contest elections. at least one mp in a grc must be of an ethnic minority background. all elections are held using firstpastthepost voting. mps host weekly political surgeries, called meetthepeople sessions, where they help constituents resolve personal issues which can be related to housing, financial assistance, and immigration.the peoples action party occupies a dominant position in singaporean politics, having won large parliamentary majorities in every election since selfgovernance was granted in . the pap, selfdescribed as pragmatic, have a syncretic ideology combining freemarket principles, civil nationalism, and welfarism. despite promulgating restrictions on civil liberties, singapore under the pap has seen consistent economic growth and political stability. the most represented and popular opposition party is the workers party.the judicial system is based on english common law, continuing the legal tradition established during british rule and with substantial local differences. criminal law is based on the indian penal code originally intended for british india, and was at the time as a crown colony also adopted by the british colonial authorities in singapore and remains the basis of the criminal code in the country with a few exceptions, amendments and repeals since it came into force. trial by jury was abolished in . both corporal punishment  and capital punishment  are legal penalties.the right to freedom of speech and association is guaranteed by article  of the constitution of singapore, although there are provisions in the subsequent subsection that regulate them. the government has restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press as well as some civil and political rights. in , singapore was ranked th out of  nations by reporters without borders on the global press freedom index. freedom house ranks singapore as partly free in its freedom in the world report, and the economist intelligence unit ranks singapore as a flawed democracy, the second freest rank of four, in its democracy index. all public gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the speakers corner.in the corruption perceptions index, which ranks countries by perceived levels of public sector corruption, singapore has consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. singapores unique combination of a strong, almost authoritarian, government with an emphasis on meritocracy and good governance is known as the singapore model, and is regarded as a key factor behind singapores political stability, economic growth, and harmonious social order. in , the world justice projects rule of law index ranked singapore as th overall among the worlds  countries for adherence to the rule of law. singapore ranked high on the factors of order and security , absence of corruption , regulatory enforcement , civil justice , and criminal justice , and ranked significantly lower on factors of open government , constraints on government powers , and fundamental rights .

singapores stated foreign policy priority is maintaining security in southeast asia and surrounding territories. an underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region. it has diplomatic relations with more than  sovereign states.as one of the five founding members of asean, singapore is a strong supporter of the asean free trade area  and the asean investment area ; it is also the host of the apec secretariat. singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations, such as asiaeurope meeting, the forum for east asialatin american cooperation, the indian ocean rim association, and the east asia summit. it is also a member of the nonaligned movement, the united nations and the commonwealth. while singapore is not a formal member of the g, it has been invited to participate in g processes in most years since . singapore is also the location of the pacific economic cooperation council  secretariat.in general, bilateral relations with other asean members are strong; however, disagreements have arisen, and relations with neighbouring malaysia and indonesia have sometimes been strained. malaysia and singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to singapore, and access by the singapore armed forces to malaysian airspace. border issues exist with malaysia and indonesia, and both have banned the sale of marine sand to singapore over disputes about singapores land reclamation. some previous disputes, such as the pedra branca dispute, have been resolved by the international court of justice. piracy in the strait of malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries. close economic ties exist with brunei, and the two share a pegged currency value, through a currency interchangeability agreement between the two countries which makes both brunei dollar and singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender in either country.the first diplomatic contact with china was made in the s, with full diplomatic relations established in the s. china has been singapores largest trading partner since , after surpassing malaysia. singapore and the united states share a longstanding close relationship, in particular in defence, the economy, health, and education. singapore has also increased cooperation with asean members and china to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism, and participated in aseans first joint maritime exercise with china in . it has also given support to the usled coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral cooperation in counterterrorism and counterproliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.as singapore has diplomatic relations with both the united states and north korea, and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries, in june , it hosted a historic summit between us president donald trump and north korean leader kim jongun, the firstever meeting between the sitting leaders of the two nations. it also hosted the maxi meeting in , the first meeting between the political leaders of the two sides of the taiwan strait since the end of the chinese civil war in .

the singaporean military, arguably the most technologically advanced in southeast asia, consists of the army, the navy, the air force and the digital and intelligence service. it is seen as the guarantor of the countrys independence, translating into singapore culture, involving all citizens in the countrys defence. the government spends . of the countrys gdp on the militaryhigh by regional standardsand one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence.after its independence, singapore had only two infantry regiments commanded by british officers. considered too small to provide effective security for the new country, the development of its military forces became a priority. in addition, in october , britain pulled its military out of singapore, leaving behind only a small british, australian and new zealand force as a token military presence. a great deal of initial support came from israel, a country unrecognised by singapores neighbouring muslimmajority nations of malaysia and indonesia. the israel defense forces  commanders were tasked by the singapore government to create the singapore armed forces  from scratch, and israeli instructors were brought in to train singaporean soldiers. military courses were conducted according to the idfs format, and singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the israeli model. singapore still maintains strong security ties with israel and is one of the biggest buyers of israeli arms and weapons systems, with one recent example being the matador antitank weapon.the saf is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare. the defence science and technology agency  is responsible for procuring resources for the military. the geographic restrictions of singapore mean that the saf must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they cannot fall back and regroup. the small size of the population has also affected the way the saf has been designed, with a small active force and a large number of reserves.

singapore has conscription for all ablebodied males at age , except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families. males who have yet to complete preuniversity education, are awarded the public service commission  scholarship, or are pursuing a local medical degree can opt to defer their draft. though not required to perform military service, the number of women in the saf has been increasing since  they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men. before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least nine weeks of basic military training.because of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare are often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access. however, largescale drills, considered too dangerous to be performed in the country, have been performed in other countries such as brunei, indonesia, thailand and the united states. in general, military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week. due to airspace and land constraints, the republic of singapore air force  maintains a number of overseas bases in australia, the united states, and france. the rsafs  squadron is based in raaf base pearce, western australia, and its  squadron is based in the oakey army aviation centre, queensland. the rsaf has one squadronthe  squadronbased in cazaux air base in southern france. the rsafs overseas detachments in the united states are luke air force base in arizona, marana in arizona, mountain home air force base in idaho, and andersen air force base in guam.the saf has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as iraq, and afghanistan, in both military and civilian roles. in the region, they have helped to stabilise east timor and have provided aid to aceh in indonesia following the  indian ocean earthquake and tsunami. since , the republic of singapore navy  has deployed ships to the gulf of aden to aid in countering piracy efforts as part of task force . the saf also helped in relief efforts during hurricane katrina, and typhoon haiyan. singapore is part of the five power defence arrangements , a military alliance with australia, malaysia, new zealand, and the united kingdom. in , singapore was ranked the th most peaceful country on the global peace index.

capital punishment is a legal and enforced penalty in singapore. the country is one of four in the developed world to retain the death penalty, along with the united states, japan and taiwan. particularly, its use against drug trafficking has been a source of contention with various nongovernmental organisations, regarded by some as a victimless crime. the government has responded that it has no doubts that it is the right policy and that there is clear evidence of serious deterrence, and that the law should be looked at upon in the wider context of saving lives, particularly citizens. in , amnesty international claimed that some legal provisions of the singapore system for the death penalty conflict with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. the government has disputed amnestys claims, stating that their position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally and that the report contains grave errors of facts and misrepresentations.from  to , sexual relations between men were technically illegal under section a of the penal code, first introduced during british colonial rule. during the last few decades, the law was unenforced and pressure to repeal this law increased as homosexuality became more understood. meanwhile, sexual relations between women had always been legal. in , prime minister lee hsien loong announced that singapore would scrap a for good, effectively decriminalising homosexual behaviour. nevertheless, he added that the repeal will not affect the recognition of traditional familial and societal norms, including how marriage is definedputting the legalisation of samesex marriage on the backburner at least for now, although the possibility of civil unions was not officially ruled out. he added this was a compromise between the conservative  and progressive elements of singaporean society to prevent fracturing it.pink dot sg, an event held in support of the lgbt community, has drawn thousands of people annually since  with increasing attendance. according to a survey conducted by the institute of policy studies in , singaporean society has become more liberal on lgbt rights. in the survey, more than  of people said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, up from  in . the survey found that  felt the same way about samesex marriage  and  did so about samesex couples adopting a child . in ,  singaporeans protested for improved trans protections in the educational system outside the ministry of education headquarters at buona vista.pimps often traffic women from neighbouring countries such as china, malaysia and vietnam at their brothels as well as rented apartments and hostels for higher profit margins when they get a cut from customers. in response, amendments were made to the womens charter by the government in  to legislate more serious punishments for traffickers, including imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of s,.

dynamic and businessfriendly. for several years, singapore has been one of the few countries with an aaa credit rating from the big three, and the only asian country to achieve this rating. singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zerotolerance against corruption. it was the worlds th most competitive economy in , according to the international institute for management developments world competitiveness ranking of  countries, with the  highest gdp  per capita. roughly  percent of the singaporean workforce is made up of nonsingaporeans. despite market freedom, singapores government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing  of the gdp. the city is a popular location for conferences and events.

the currency of singapore is the singapore dollar , issued by the monetary authority of singapore . it has been interchangeable with the brunei dollar at par value since . mas manages its monetary policy by allowing the singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. this is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy. singapore has the worlds eleventh largest foreign reserves, and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.singapore has been identified as a tax haven for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreignbased income and capital gains. individuals such as australian millionaire retailer brett blundy and multibillionaire facebook cofounder eduardo saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in singapore. in , singapore was removed from the organisation for economic cooperation and development  liste grise of tax havens, and ranked fourth on the tax justice networks  financial secrecy index of the worlds offshore financial service providers, banking oneeighth of the worlds offshore capital, while providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities. in august , the straits times reported that indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near singapore to bring indonesian capital back into the tax base. in october , the monetary authority of singapore admonished and fined ubs and dbs and withdrew falcon private banks banking licence for their alleged role in the malaysian sovereign fund scandal.in , singapore was rated the worlds most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the economist intelligence unit, and this remained true in . the government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the ministry of social and family development, so acute poverty is rare. some of the programmes include providing financial assistance to needy households, providing free medical care at government hospitals, and paying for childrens tuition. other benefits include compensation for gym fees to encourage citizens to exercise, up to s, as a baby bonus for each citizen, heavily subsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reducedcost laptops for poor students, rebates for costs such as public transport and utility bills, and more. as of  singapores ranking in the human development index is th in the world, with an hdi value of ..

singapore consists of  islands, including the main island, pulau ujong. there are two manmade connections to johor, malaysia the johorsingapore causeway in the north and the tuas second link in the west. jurong island, pulau tekong, pulau ubin and sentosa are the largest of singapores smaller islands. the highest natural point is bukit timah hill at . m . under british rule, christmas island and the cocos islands were part of singapore, and both were transferred to australia in . pedra branca is the nations easternmost point.land reclamation projects have increased singapores land area from  km  in the s to  km  by , an increase of some  . the country is projected to reclaim another  km . some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more functional and habitable islands, as has been done with jurong island. the type of sand used in reclamation is found in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. in  singapore imported almost  million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that indonesia, malaysia, and vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to singapore in recent years. as a result, in  singapore switched to using polders for reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped dry.

singapores urbanisation means that it has lost  of its historical forests, and now over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in singapore is present in nature reserves, such as the bukit timah nature reserve and the sungei buloh wetland reserve, which comprise only . of singapores land area. in , to combat this decline in natural space, the government introduced the vision of making singapore a garden city, aiming to improve quality of life. since then, nearly  of singapores land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves. the government has created plans to preserve the countrys remaining wildlife. singapores well known gardens include the singapore botanic gardens, a yearold tropical garden and singapores first unesco world heritage site.

singapore has a tropical rainforest climate  with no distinctive seasons, uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. temperatures usually range from  to  c . while temperature does not vary greatly throughout the year, there is a wetter monsoon season from november to february.from july to october, there is often haze caused by bush fires in neighbouring indonesia, usually from the island of sumatra. singapore follows the gmt time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location. this causes the sun to rise and set particularly late during february, where the sun rises at  am and sets around  pm. during july, the sun sets at around  pm. the earliest the sun rises and sets is in late october and early november when the sun rises at  am and sets at  pm.singapore recognises that climate change and rising sea levels in the decades ahead will have major implications for its lowlying coastline. it estimates that the nation will need to spend  billion over the course of the next century to address the issue. in its  budget, the government set aside an initial  billion towards a coastline and flood protection fund. singapore is the first country in southeast asia to levy a carbon tax on its largest carbonemitting corporations producing more than , tons of carbon dioxide per year, at  per ton.to reduce the countrys dependence on fossil fuels, it has ramped up deployment of solar panels on rooftops and vertical surfaces of buildings, and other initiatives like building one of the worlds largest floating solar farms at tengeh reservoir in tuas.

singapore considers water a national security issue and the government has sought to emphasise conservation. water access is universal and of high quality, though the country is projected to face significant waterstress by . to circumvent this, the public utilities board has implemented the four national taps strategy  water imported from neighbouring malaysia, urban rainwater catchments, reclaimed water  and seawater desalination. singapores approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure; it also emphasises proper legislation and enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development. singapore has declared that it will be water selfsufficient by the time its  longterm water supply agreement with malaysia expires in . however, according to official forecasts, water demand in singapore is expected to double from  to  million us gallons  per day between  and . the increase is expected to come primarily from nondomestic water use, which accounted for  of water demand in  and is expected to account for  of demand in . by that time, water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of  and by desalination accounting for , compared to only  supplied by internal catchments.singapore is expanding its recycling system and intends to spend . billion  in water treatment infrastructure upgrades. the ulu pandan wastewater treatment was specially built to test advanced usedwater treatment processes before full deployment and won the water/wastewater project of the year award at the  global water awards in paris, france. operation started in  and was jointly developed by pub and the black  veatch  aecom joint venture.

elizabeth i  was queen of england and ireland from  november  until her death in . elizabeth was the last monarch of the house of tudor and is sometimes referred to as the virgin queen.elizabeth was the only surviving daughter of henry viii by anne boleyn, his second wife, who was executed when elizabeth was two years old. annes marriage to henry was annulled, and elizabeth declared illegitimate. henry restored her to the line of succession when she was ten, via the third succession act . after henrys death in , elizabeths younger halfbrother edward vi ruled until his own death in , bequeathing the crown to a protestant cousin, lady jane grey and ignoring the claims of his two halfsisters, the catholic mary and the younger elizabeth, in spite of statutes to the contrary. edwards will was set aside within weeks of his death and mary became queen, deposing and executing jane. during marys reign, elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting protestant rebels.

upon her halfsisters death in , elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by william cecil, whom she created baron burghley. one of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an english protestant church, of which she became the supreme governor. this elizabethan religious settlement was to evolve into the church of england. it was expected that elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. she was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, james vi of scotland, the son of mary, queen of scots.

in government, elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings had been. one of her mottoes was video et taceo . in religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. after the pope declared her illegitimate in , which in theory released english catholics from allegiance to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers secret service, run by francis walsingham. elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of france and spain. she halfheartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the netherlands, france, and ireland. by the mids, england could no longer avoid war with spain.

as she grew older, elizabeth became celebrated for her virginity. a cult of personality grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. elizabeths reign became known as the elizabethan era. the period is famous for the flourishing of english drama, led by playwrights such as william shakespeare and christopher marlowe, the prowess of english maritime adventurers, such as francis drake and walter raleigh, and for the defeat of the spanish armada. some historians depict elizabeth as a shorttempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer  and a dogged survivor  in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. after the short, disastrous reigns of her siblings, her  years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.

elizabeth was born at greenwich palace on  september  and was named after her grandmothers, elizabeth of york and lady elizabeth howard. she was the second child of henry viii of england born in wedlock to survive infancy. her mother was henrys second wife, anne boleyn. at birth, elizabeth was the heir presumptive to the english throne. her elder halfsister mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when henry annulled his marriage to marys mother, catherine of aragon, to marry anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the tudor succession. she was baptised on  september , and her godparents were thomas cranmer, archbishop of canterbury; henry courtenay, st marquess of exeter; elizabeth stafford, duchess of norfolk; and margaret wotton, dowager marchioness of dorset. a canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle george boleyn, viscount rochford; john hussey, st baron hussey of sleaford; lord thomas howard; and william howard, st baron howard of effingham.elizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on  may , four months after catherine of aragons death from natural causes. elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of her place in the royal succession. eleven days after anne boleyns execution, henry married jane seymour. queen jane died the next year shortly after the birth of their son, edward, who was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. elizabeth was placed in her halfbrothers household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.

elizabeths first governess, margaret bryan, wrote that she was as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever i knew any in my life. catherine champernowne, better known by her later, married name of catherine kat ashley, was appointed as elizabeths governess in , and she remained elizabeths friend until her death in . champernowne taught elizabeth four languages french, dutch, italian and spanish. by the time william grindal became her tutor in , elizabeth could write english, latin, and italian. under grindal, a talented and skilful tutor, she also progressed in french and greek. by the age of , she was able to translate her stepmother catherine parrs religious work prayers or meditations from english into italian, latin, and french, which she presented to her father as a new years gift. from her teenage years and throughout her life, she translated works in latin and greek by numerous classical authors, including the pro marcello of cicero, the de consolatione philosophiae of boethius, a treatise by plutarch, and the annals of tacitus. a translation of tacitus from lambeth palace library, one of only four surviving english translations from the early modern era, was confirmed as elizabeths own in , after a detailed analysis of the handwriting and paper was undertaken.after grindal died in , elizabeth received her education under her brother edwards tutor, roger ascham, a sympathetic teacher who believed that learning should be engaging. current knowledge of elizabeths schooling and precocity comes largely from aschams memoirs. by the time her formal education ended in , elizabeth was one of the best educated women of her generation. at the end of her life, she was believed to speak the welsh, cornish, scottish and irish languages in addition to those mentioned above. the venetian ambassador stated in  that she possessed these languages so thoroughly that each appeared to be her native tongue. historian mark stoyle suggests that she was probably taught cornish by william killigrew, groom of the privy chamber and later chamberlain of the exchequer.

henry viii died in  and elizabeths halfbrother, edward vi, became king at the age of nine. catherine parr, henrys widow, soon married thomas seymour, st baron seymour of sudeley, edward vis uncle and the brother of lord protector edward seymour, st duke of somerset. the couple took elizabeth into their household at chelsea. there elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life. thomas seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the yearold elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks. elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits. parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in. twice she accompanied him in tickling elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown into a thousand pieces. however, after parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs. in may , elizabeth was sent away.

thomas seymour nevertheless continued scheming to control the royal family and tried to have himself appointed the governor of the kings person. when parr died after childbirth on  september , he renewed his attentions towards elizabeth, intent on marrying her. her governess kat ashley, who was fond of seymour, sought to convince elizabeth to take him as her husband. she tried to convince elizabeth to write to seymour and comfort him in his sorrow, but elizabeth claimed that thomas was not so saddened by her stepmothers death as to need comfort.

in january , seymour was arrested and imprisoned in the tower on suspicion of conspiring to depose his brother somerset as protector, marry lady jane grey to king edward vi, and take elizabeth as his own wife. elizabeth, living at hatfield house, would admit nothing. her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, robert tyrwhitt, who reported, i do see it in her face that she is guilty. seymour was beheaded on  march .

edward vi died on  july , aged . his will ignored the succession to the crown act , excluded both mary and elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir lady jane grey, granddaughter of henry viiis younger sister mary tudor, queen of france. jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. on  august , mary rode triumphantly into london, with elizabeth at her side.

the show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. mary, a devout catholic, was determined to crush the protestant faith in which elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend catholic mass; elizabeth had to outwardly conform. marys initial popularity ebbed away in  when she announced plans to marry philip of spain, the son of holy roman emperor charles v and an active catholic. discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to marys religious policies.

in january and february , wyatts rebellion broke out; it was soon suppressed. elizabeth was brought to court and interrogated regarding her role, and on  march, she was imprisoned in the tower of london. elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. though it is unlikely that she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. marys closest confidant, emperor charless ambassador simon renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while elizabeth lived; and lord chancellor stephen gardiner, worked to have elizabeth put on trial. elizabeths supporters in the government, including william paget, st baron paget, convinced mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. instead, on  may, elizabeth was moved from the tower to woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of henry bedingfeld. crowds cheered her all along the way.on  april , elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of marys apparent pregnancy. if mary and her child died, elizabeth would become queen, but if mary gave birth to a healthy child, elizabeths chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. when it became clear that mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. elizabeths succession seemed assured.king philip, who ascended the spanish throne in , acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sisterinlaw. she was a better ally than the chief alternative, mary, queen of scots, who had grown up in france and was betrothed to the dauphin of france. when his wife fell ill in , king philip sent the count of feria to consult with elizabeth. this interview was conducted at hatfield house, where she had returned to live in october . by october , elizabeth was already making plans for her government. mary recognised elizabeth as her heir on  november , and elizabeth became queen when mary died on  november.

elizabeth became queen at the age of , and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to hatfield to swear allegiance. the speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval political theology of the sovereigns two bodies the body natural and the body politic

my lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering i am gods creature, ordained to obey his appointment, i will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that i may have assistance of his grace to be the minister of his heavenly will in this office now committed to me. and as i am but one body naturally considered, though by his permission a body politic to govern, so shall i desire you all ... to be assistant to me, that i with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to almighty god and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. i mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.

as her triumphal progress wound through the city on the eve of the coronation ceremony, she was welcomed wholeheartedly by the citizens and greeted by orations and pageants, most with a strong protestant flavour. elizabeths open and gracious responses endeared her to the spectators, who were wonderfully ravished. the following day,  january , a date chosen by her astrologer john dee, elizabeth was crowned and anointed by owen oglethorpe, the catholic bishop of carlisle, in westminster abbey. she was then presented for the peoples acceptance, amidst a deafening noise of organs, fifes, trumpets, drums, and bells. although elizabeth was welcomed as queen in england, the country was still in a state of anxiety over the perceived catholic threat at home and overseas, as well as the choice of whom she would marry.

elizabeths personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars. she was a protestant, but kept catholic symbols , and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key protestant belief.elizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a catholic crusade against heretical england. the queen therefore sought a protestant solution that would not offend catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of english protestants, but she would not tolerate the puritans, who were pushing for farreaching reforms. as a result, the parliament of  started to legislate for a church based on the protestant settlement of edward vi, with the monarch as its head, but with many catholic elements, such as vestments.the house of commons backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the house of lords, particularly from the bishops. elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the archbishopric of canterbury. this enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. nevertheless, elizabeth was forced to accept the title of supreme governor of the church of england rather than the more contentious title of supreme head, which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. the new act of supremacy became law on  may . all public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by mary. at the same time, a new act of uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of the  book of common prayer  compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.

from the start of elizabeths reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom. although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear. historians have speculated that thomas seymour had put her off sexual relationships. she considered several suitors until she was about fifty. her last courtship was with francis, duke of anjou,  years her junior. while risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of king philip ii of spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. however, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.

in the spring of , it became evident that elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend robert dudley. it was said that his wife amy was suffering from a malady in one of her breasts and that the queen would like to marry robert if his wife should die. by the autumn of , several foreign suitors were vying for elizabeths hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in england there is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation ... she will marry none but the favoured robert. amy dudley died in september , from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroners inquest finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen. elizabeth seriously considered marrying dudley for some time. however, william cecil, nicholas throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. there were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.among other marriage candidates being considered for the queen, robert dudley continued to be regarded as a possible candidate for nearly another decade. elizabeth was extremely jealous of his affections, even when she no longer meant to marry him herself. she raised dudley to the peerage as earl of leicester in . in , he finally married lettice knollys, to whom the queen reacted with repeated scenes of displeasure and lifelong hatred. still, dudley always remained at the centre of elizabeths emotional life, as historian susan doran has described the situation. he died shortly after the defeat of the spanish armada in . after elizabeths own death, a note from him was found among her most personal belongings, marked his last letter in her handwriting.

marriage negotiations constituted a key element in elizabeths foreign policy. she turned down the hand of philip, her halfsisters widower, early in  but for several years entertained the proposal of king eric xiv of sweden. earlier in elizabeths life a danish match for her had been discussed; henry viii had proposed one with the danish prince adolf, duke of holsteingottorp, in , and edward seymour, duke of somerset, suggested a marriage with prince frederick  several years later, but the negotiations had abated in . in the years around  a danoenglish protestant alliance was considered, and to counter swedens proposal, king frederick ii proposed to elizabeth in late .

for several years she also seriously negotiated to marry philips cousin charles ii, archduke of austria. by , relations with the habsburgs had deteriorated. elizabeth considered marriage to two french valois princes in turn, first henry, duke of anjou, and then from  to  his brother francis, duke of anjou, formerly duke of alençon. this last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against spanish control of the southern netherlands. elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frogshaped earring that francis had sent her.in , elizabeth told an imperial envoy if i follow the inclination of my nature, it is this beggarwoman and single, far rather than queen and married. later in the year, following elizabeths illness with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue in parliament. members urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, to prevent a civil war upon her death. she refused to do either. in april she prorogued the parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in .

having previously promised to marry, she told an unruly house

i will never break the word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honours sake. and therefore i say again, i will marry as soon as i can conveniently, if god take not him away with whom i mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let obstruction happen.

by , senior figures in the government privately accepted that elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. william cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. for her failure to marry, elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. her silence, however, strengthened her own political security she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she remembered the way that a second person, as i have been had been used as the focus of plots against her predecessor.

elizabeths unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the virgin mary. in poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman. at first, only elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity in , she told the commons, and, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin. later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an iconography that exalted elizabeth. public tributes to the virgin by  acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queens marriage negotiations with the duke of alençon. ultimately, elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. in , she spoke of all my husbands, my good people.

this claim of virginity was not universally accepted. catholics accused elizabeth of engaging in filthy lust that symbolically defiled the nation along with her body. henry iv of france said that one of the great questions of europe was whether queen elizabeth was a maid or no.a central issue, when it comes to the question of elizabeths virginity, was whether the queen ever consummated her love affair with robert dudley. in , she had dudleys bedchambers moved next to her own apartments. in , she was mysteriously bedridden with an illness that caused her body to swell.in , a young man calling himself arthur dudley was arrested on the coast of spain under suspicion of being a spy. the man claimed to be the illegitimate son of elizabeth and robert dudley, with his age being consistent with birth during the  illness. he was taken to madrid for investigation, where he was examined by francis englefield, a catholic aristocrat exiled to spain and secretary to king philip ii. three letters exist today describing the interview, detailing what arthur proclaimed to be the story of his life, from birth in the royal palace to the time of his arrival in spain. however, this failed to convince the spanish englefield admitted to king philip that arthurs claim at present amounts to nothing, but suggested that he should not be allowed to get away, but ... kept very secure. the king agreed, and arthur was never heard from again. modern scholarship dismisses the storys basic premise as impossible, and asserts that elizabeths life was so closely observed by contemporaries that she could not have hidden a pregnancy.

elizabeths first policy toward scotland was to oppose the french presence there. she feared that the french planned to invade england and put her catholic cousin mary, queen of scots, on the throne. mary was considered by many to be the heir to the english crown, being the granddaughter of henry viiis elder sister, margaret. mary boasted being the nearest kinswoman she hath. elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into scotland to aid the protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting treaty of edinburgh of july  removed the french threat in the north. when mary returned to scotland in  to take up the reins of power, the country had an established protestant church and was run by a council of protestant nobles supported by elizabeth. mary refused to ratify the treaty.in , elizabeth proposed her own suitor, robert dudley, as a husband for mary, without asking either of the two people concerned. both proved unenthusiastic, and in , mary married henry stuart, lord darnley, who carried his own claim to the english throne. the marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by mary that handed the victory to the scottish protestants and to elizabeth. darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in february  by conspirators almost certainly led by james hepburn, th earl of bothwell. shortly afterwards, on  may , mary married bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. elizabeth confronted mary about the marriage, writing to her

how could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.

these events led rapidly to marys defeat and imprisonment in lochleven castle. the scottish lords forced her to abdicate in favour of her son james vi, who had been born in june . james was taken to stirling castle to be raised as a protestant. mary escaped in  but after a defeat at langside sailed to england, where she had once been assured of support from elizabeth. elizabeths first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch, but she and her council instead chose to play safe. rather than risk returning mary to scotland with an english army or sending her to france and the catholic enemies of england, they detained her in england, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.

mary was soon the focus for rebellion. in  there was a major catholic rising in the north; the goal was to free mary, marry her to thomas howard, th duke of norfolk, and put her on the english throne. after the rebels defeat, over  of them were executed on elizabeths orders. in the belief that the revolt had been successful, pope pius v issued a bull in , titled regnans in excelsis, which declared elizabeth, the pretended queen of england and the servant of crime to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication. the papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against catholics by parliament, which were, however, mitigated by elizabeths intervention. in , to convert english subjects to catholicism with the intent to withdraw them from their allegiance to elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. from the s missionary priests from continental seminaries went to england secretly in the cause of the reconversion of england. many suffered execution, engendering a cult of martyrdom.regnans in excelsis gave english catholics a strong incentive to look to mary as the legitimate sovereign of england. mary may not have been told of every catholic plot to put her on the english throne, but from the ridolfi plot of   to the babington plot of , elizabeths spymaster francis walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. at first, elizabeth resisted calls for marys death. by late , she had been persuaded to sanction marys trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the babington plot. elizabeths proclamation of the sentence announced that the said mary, pretending title to the same crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm diverse things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person. on  february , mary was beheaded at fotheringhay castle, northamptonshire. after the execution, elizabeth claimed that she had not intended for the signed execution warrant to be dispatched, and blamed her secretary, william davison, for implementing it without her knowledge. the sincerity of elizabeths remorse and whether or not she wanted to delay the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.

elizabeths foreign policy was largely defensive. the exception was the english occupation of le havre from october  to june , which ended in failure when elizabeths huguenot allies joined with the catholics to retake the port. elizabeths intention had been to exchange le havre for calais, lost to france in january . only through the activities of her fleets did elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. this paid off in the war against spain,  of which was fought at sea. she knighted francis drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from  to , and he won fame for his raids on spanish ports and fleets. an element of piracy and selfenrichment drove elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.

after the occupation and loss of le havre in , elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until , when she sent an english army to aid the protestant dutch rebels against philip ii. this followed the deaths in  of the queens allies william the silent, prince of orange, and the duke of anjou, and the surrender of a series of dutch towns to alexander farnese, duke of parma, philips governor of the spanish netherlands. in december , an alliance between philip ii and the french catholic league at joinville undermined the ability of anjous brother, henry iii of france, to counter spanish domination of the netherlands. it also extended spanish influence along the channel coast of france, where the catholic league was strong, and exposed england to invasion. the siege of antwerp in the summer of  by the duke of parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the english and the dutch. the outcome was the treaty of nonsuch of august , in which elizabeth promised military support to the dutch. the treaty marked the beginning of the anglospanish war, which lasted until the treaty of london in .

the expedition was led by elizabeths former suitor, the earl of leicester. elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. her strategy, to support the dutch on the surface with an english army, while beginning secret peace talks with spain within days of leicesters arrival in holland, had necessarily to be at odds with leicesters, who had set up a protectorate and was expected by the dutch to fight an active campaign. elizabeth, on the other hand, wanted him to avoid at all costs any decisive action with the enemy. he enraged elizabeth by accepting the post of governorgeneral from the dutch states general. elizabeth saw this as a dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the netherlands, which so far she had always declined. she wrote to leicester

we could never have imagined  that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour ... and therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.

elizabeths commandment was that her emissary read out her letters of disapproval publicly before the dutch council of state, leicester having to stand nearby. this public humiliation of her lieutenantgeneral combined with her continued talks for a separate peace with spain irreversibly undermined leicesters standing among the dutch. the military campaign was severely hampered by elizabeths repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, leicesters own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the factionridden and chaotic situation of dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign. leicester finally resigned his command in december .

meanwhile, francis drake had undertaken a major voyage against spanish ports and ships in the caribbean in  and . in  he made a successful raid on cádiz, destroying the spanish fleet of war ships intended for the enterprise of england, as philip ii had decided to take the war to england.on  july , the spanish armada, a great fleet of ships, set sail for the channel, planning to ferry a spanish invasion force under the duke of parma to the coast of southeast england from the netherlands. the armada was defeated by a combination of miscalculation, misfortune, and an attack of english fire ships off gravelines at midnight on  july , which dispersed the spanish ships to the northeast. the armada straggled home to spain in shattered remnants, after disastrous losses on the coast of ireland . unaware of the armadas fate, english militias mustered to defend the country under the earl of leicesters command. leicester invited elizabeth to inspect her troops at tilbury in essex on  august. wearing a silver breastplate over a white velvet dress, she addressed them in one of her most famous speeches

my loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but i assure you, i do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people ... i know i have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but i have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of england too, and think foul scorn that parma or spain, or any prince of europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.

when no invasion came, the nation rejoiced. elizabeths procession to a thanksgiving service at st pauls cathedral rivalled that of her coronation as a spectacle. the defeat of the armada was a potent propaganda victory, both for elizabeth and for protestant england. the english took their delivery as a symbol of gods favour and of the nations inviolability under a virgin queen. however, the victory was not a turning point in the war, which continued and often favoured spain. the spanish still controlled the southern provinces of the netherlands, and the threat of invasion remained. walter raleigh claimed after her death that elizabeths caution had impeded the war against spain

if the late queen would have believed her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times. but her majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.

though some historians have criticised elizabeth on similar grounds, raleighs verdict has more often been judged unfair. elizabeth had good reason not to place too much trust in her commanders, who once in action tended, as she put it herself, to be transported with an haviour of vainglory.in , the year after the spanish armada, elizabeth sent to spain the english armada or counter armada with , men and  ships, led by francis drake as admiral and john norreys as general. the english fleet suffered a catastrophic defeat with ,, killed, wounded or died of disease and  ships sunk or captured. the advantage england had won upon the destruction of the spanish armada was lost, and the spanish victory marked a revival of philip iis naval power through the next decade.

when the protestant henry iv inherited the french throne in , elizabeth sent him military support. it was her first venture into france since the retreat from le havre in . henrys succession was strongly contested by the catholic league and by philip ii, and elizabeth feared a spanish takeover of the channel ports.

the subsequent english campaigns in france, however, were disorganised and ineffective. peregrine bertie, largely ignoring elizabeths orders, roamed northern france to little effect, with an army of , men. he withdrew in disarray in december , having lost half his troops. in , the campaign of john norreys, who led , men to brittany, was even more of a disaster. as for all such expeditions, elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. norreys left for london to plead in person for more support. in his absence, a catholic league army almost destroyed the remains of his army at craon, northwest france, in may .

in july, elizabeth sent out another force under robert devereux, nd earl of essex, to help henry iv in besieging rouen. the result was just as dismal. essex accomplished nothing and returned home in january . henry abandoned the siege in april. as usual, elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do, she wrote of essex, we are ignorant.

although ireland was one of her two kingdoms, elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, irish population that adhered to catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving spain a base from which to attack england. in the course of a series of uprisings, crown forces pursued scorchedearth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. during a revolt in munster led by gerald fitzgerald, in , an estimated , irish people starved to death. the poet and colonist edmund spenser wrote that the victims were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same. elizabeth advised her commanders that the irish, that rude and barbarous nation, be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose.between  and , elizabeth faced her most severe test in ireland during the nine years war, a revolt that took place at the height of hostilities with spain, who backed the rebel leader, hugh oneill. in spring , elizabeth sent robert devereux, to put the revolt down. to her frustration, he made little progress and returned to england in defiance of her orders. he was replaced by charles blount, who took three years to defeat the rebels. oneill finally surrendered in , a few days after elizabeths death. soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between england and spain.

elizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the tsardom of russia that were originally established by her halfbrother, edward vi. she often wrote to tsar ivan the terrible on amicable terms, though the tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance. ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in england should his rule be jeopardised. english merchant and explorer anthony jenkinson, who began his career as a representative of the muscovy company, became the queens special ambassador to the court of tsar ivan.upon his death in , ivan was succeeded by his son feodor i. unlike his father, feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with england. he declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the english ambassador jerome bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by ivan. elizabeth sent a new ambassador, dr. giles fletcher, to demand from the regent boris godunov that he convince the tsar to reconsider. the negotiations failed, due to fletcher addressing feodor with two of his many titles omitted. elizabeth continued to appeal to feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. she proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by feodors father, but was turned down.

trade and diplomatic relations developed between england and the barbary states during the rule of elizabeth. england established a trading relationship with morocco in opposition to spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for moroccan sugar, in spite of a papal ban. in , abd elouahed ben messaoud, the principal secretary to the moroccan ruler mulai ahmad almansur, visited england as an ambassador to the english court, to negotiate an anglomoroccan alliance against spain. elizabeth agreed to sell munitions supplies to morocco, and she and mulai ahmad almansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the spanish. discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.diplomatic relations were also established with the ottoman empire with the chartering of the levant company and the dispatch of the first english ambassador to the sublime porte, william harborne, in . for the first time, a treaty of commerce was signed in . numerous envoys were dispatched in both directions and epistolar exchanges occurred between elizabeth and sultan murad iii. in one correspondence, murad entertained the notion that protestantism and islam had much more in common than either did with roman catholicism, as both rejected the worship of idols, and argued for an alliance between england and the ottoman empire. to the dismay of catholic europe, england exported tin and lead  and ammunitions to the ottoman empire, and elizabeth seriously discussed joint military operations with murad iii during the outbreak of war with spain in , as francis walsingham was lobbying for a direct ottoman military involvement against the common spanish enemy.

in , humphrey gilbert sailed west to establish a colony in newfoundland. he never returned to england. gilberts halfbrother walter raleigh explored the atlantic coast and claimed the territory of virginia, perhaps named in honour of elizabeth, the virgin queen. this territory was much larger than the presentday state of virginia, extending from new england to the carolinas. in , raleigh returned to virginia with a small group of people. they landed on roanoke island, off presentday north carolina. after the failure of the first colony, raleigh recruited another group and put john white in command. when raleigh returned in , there was no trace of the roanoke colony he had left, but it was the first english settlement in north america.

the east india company was formed to trade in the indian ocean region and china, and received its charter from queen elizabeth on  december . for a period of  years, the company was awarded a monopoly on english trade with all countries east of the cape of good hope and west of the straits of magellan. james lancaster commanded the first expedition in . the company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in india in the th and th centuries.

the period after the defeat of the spanish armada in  brought new difficulties for elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. the conflicts with spain and in ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. prices rose and the standard of living fell. during this time, repression of catholics intensified, and elizabeth authorised commissions in  to interrogate and monitor catholic householders. to maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. in her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the publics affection for her.

one of the causes for this second reign of elizabeth, as it is sometimes called, was the changed character of elizabeths governing body, the privy council in the s. a new generation was in power. with the exception of william cecil, baron burghley, the most important politicians had died around  the earl of leicester in ; francis walsingham in ; and christopher hatton in . factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the s, now became its hallmark. a bitter rivalry arose between robert devereux, the earl of essex, and robert cecil, son of lord burghley, with both being supported by their respective adherents. the struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred the kingdoms politics. the queens personal authority was lessening, as is shown in the  affair of dr. lopez, her trusted physician. when he was wrongly accused by the earl of essex of treason out of personal pique, she could not prevent the doctors execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.during the last years of her reign, elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a costfree system of patronage, rather than asking parliament for more subsidies in a time of war. the practice soon led to pricefixing, the enrichment of courtiers at the publics expense, and widespread resentment. this culminated in agitation in the house of commons during the parliament of . in her famous golden speech of  november  at whitehall palace to a deputation of  members, elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions

who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. and as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us

this same period of economic and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in england. the first signs of a new literary movement had appeared at the end of the second decade of elizabeths reign, with john lylys euphues and edmund spensers the shepheardes calender in . during the s, some of the great names of english literature entered their maturity, including william shakespeare and christopher marlowe. continuing into the jacobean era, the english theatre would reach its peak. the notion of a great elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during elizabeths reign. they owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.as elizabeth aged, her image gradually changed. she was portrayed as belphoebe or astraea, and after the armada, as gloriana, the eternally youthful faerie queene of edmund spensers poem. elizabeth gave edmund spenser a pension; as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work. her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. in fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in , leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. andré hurault de maisse, ambassador extraordinary from henry iv of france, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, her teeth are very yellow and unequal ... and on the left side less than on the right. many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly. yet he added, her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal. walter raleigh called her a lady whom time had surprised.

the more elizabeths beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it. elizabeth was happy to play the part, but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. she became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young earl of essex, who was leicesters stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. she repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. after essexs desertion of his command in ireland in , elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. in february , essex tried to raise a rebellion in london. he intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on  february. elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. an observer wrote in  her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail essex.

elizabeths senior adviser, lord burghley, died on  august . his political mantle passed to his son robert, who soon became the leader of the government. one task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. since elizabeth would never name her successor, robert cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. he therefore entered into a coded negotiation with james vi of scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. cecil coached the impatient james to humour elizabeth and secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions. the advice worked. jamess tone delighted elizabeth, who responded so trust i that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort. in historian j. e. neales view, elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to james, but she made them known with unmistakable if veiled phrases.

the queens health remained fair until the autumn of , when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. in february , the death of catherine carey, countess of nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend lady knollys, came as a particular blow. in march, elizabeth fell sick and remained in a settled and unremovable melancholy, and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. when robert cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped must is not a word to use to princes, little man. she died on  march  at richmond palace, between two and three in the morning. a few hours later, cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed james king of england.while it has become normative to record elizabeths death as occurring in , following english calendar reform in the s, at the time england observed new years day on  march, commonly known as lady day. thus elizabeth died on the last day of the year  in the old calendar. the modern convention is to use the old style calendar for the day and month while using the new style calendar for the year.

elizabeths coffin was carried downriver at night to whitehall, on a barge lit with torches. at her funeral on  april, the coffin was taken to westminster abbey on a hearse drawn by four horses hung with black velvet. in the words of the chronicler john stow

westminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.

elizabeth was interred in westminster abbey, in a tomb shared with her halfsister, mary i. the latin inscription on their tomb, regno consortes  urna, hic obdormimus elizabetha et maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis, translates to consorts in realm and tomb, here we sleep, elizabeth and mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection.

elizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death. expectations of king james started high but then declined. by the s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of elizabeth. elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. james was depicted as a catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. the triumphalist image that elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. godfrey goodman, bishop of gloucester, recalled when we had experience of a scottish government, the queen did seem to revive. then was her memory much magnified. elizabeths reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.the picture of elizabeth painted by her protestant admirers of the early th century has proved lasting and influential. her memory was also revived during the napoleonic wars, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion. in the victorian era, the elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day, and in the midth century, elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. historians of that period, such as j. e. neale  and a. l. rowse , interpreted elizabeths reign as a golden age of progress. neale and rowse also idealised the queen personally she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.recent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of elizabeth. her reign is famous for the defeat of the armada, and for successful raids against the spanish, such as those on cádiz in  and , but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. in ireland, elizabeths forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. rather than as a brave defender of the protestant nations against spain and the habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. she offered very limited aid to foreign protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.elizabeth established an english church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today. those who praised her later as a protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of catholic origin from the church of england. historians note that in her day, strict protestants regarded the acts of settlement and uniformity of  as a compromise. in fact, elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as francis bacon put it, to make windows into mens hearts and secret thoughts.though elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised englands status abroad. she is only a woman, only mistress of half an island, marvelled pope sixtus v, and yet she makes herself feared by spain, by france, by the empire, by all. under elizabeth, the nation gained a new selfconfidence and sense of sovereignty, as christendom fragmented. elizabeth was the first tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. she therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust to tell her the trutha style of government that her stuart successors failed to follow. some historians have called her lucky; she believed that god was protecting her. priding herself on being mere english, elizabeth trusted in god, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. in a prayer, she offered thanks to god that

at a time when wars and seditions with grievous persecutions have vexed almost all kings and countries round about me, my reign hath been peacable, and my realm a receptacle to thy afflicted church. the love of my people hath appeared firm, and the devices of my enemies frustrate.

abraham lincoln  was an american lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the th president of the united states from  until his assassination in . lincoln led the union through the american civil war to defend the nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in defeating the insurgent confederacy, abolishing slavery, expanding the power of the federal government, and modernizing the u.s. economy.

lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in indiana. he was selfeducated and became a lawyer, whig party leader, illinois state legislator, and u.s. congressman from illinois. in , he returned to his successful law practice in springfield, illinois. in , he was angered by the kansasnebraska act, which opened the territories to slavery, causing him to reenter politics. he soon became a leader of the new republican party. he reached a national audience in the  senate campaign debates against stephen a. douglas. lincoln ran for president in , sweeping the north to gain victory. proslavery elements in the south viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and southern states began seceding from the nation. during this time, the newly formed confederate states of america began seizing federal military bases in the south. a little over one month after lincoln assumed the presidency, confederate forces attacked fort sumter, a u.s. fort in south carolina. following the bombardment, lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

lincoln, a moderate republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the democratic and republican parties. his allies, the war democrats and the radical republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the southern confederates. he managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the american people. antiwar democrats  despised lincoln, and some irreconcilable proconfederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. his gettysburg address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of american national purpose. lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the souths trade. he suspended habeas corpus in maryland and elsewhere, and averted british intervention by defusing the trent affair. in , he issued the emancipation proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states in rebellion to be free. it also directed the army and navy to recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and to receive them into the armed service of the united states. lincoln pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the thirteenth amendment to the u.s. constitution, which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime.

lincoln managed his own successful reelection campaign. he sought to heal the wartorn nation through reconciliation. on april , , just five days after the wars end at appomattox, he was attending a play at fords theatre in washington, d.c., with his wife, mary, when he was fatally shot by confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth. lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the union and abolish slavery. lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in american history.

abraham lincoln was born on february , , the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln, in a log cabin on sinking spring farm near hodgenville, kentucky. he was a descendant of samuel lincoln, an englishman who migrated from hingham, norfolk, to its namesake, hingham, massachusetts, in . the family then migrated west, passing through new jersey, pennsylvania, and virginia. lincoln was also a descendant of the harrison family of virginia; his paternal grandfather and namesake, captain abraham lincoln and wife bathsheba  moved the family from virginia to jefferson county, kentucky. the captain was killed in an indian raid in . his children, including eightyearold thomas, abrahams father, witnessed the attack. thomas then worked at odd jobs in kentucky and tennessee before the family settled in hardin county, kentucky, in the early s.

lincolns mother nancy lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of lucy hanks. thomas and nancy married on june , , in washington county, and moved to elizabethtown, kentucky. they had three children sarah, abraham, and thomas, who died as an infant.thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky before losing all but  acres  of his land in court disputes over property titles. in , the family moved to indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable. indiana was a free  territory, and they settled in an unbroken forest in hurricane township, perry county, indiana. in , lincoln noted that the familys move to indiana was partly on account of slavery, but mainly due to land title difficulties.in kentucky and indiana, thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. at various times, he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. thomas and nancy were members of a separate baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.overcoming financial challenges, thomas in  obtained clear title to  acres  in indiana, an area which became the little pigeon creek community.

on october , , nancy lincoln died from milk sickness, leaving yearold sarah in charge of a household including her father, yearold abraham, and nancys yearold orphan cousin, dennis hanks. ten years later, on january , , sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating lincoln.on december , , thomas married sarah bush johnston, a widow from elizabethtown, kentucky, with three children of her own. abraham became close to his stepmother and called her mother. lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. his family even said he was lazy, for all his reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing poetry, etc.. his stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy physical labor, but loved to read.

lincoln was largely selfeducated. his formal schooling was from itinerant teachers. it included two short stints in kentucky, where he learned to read but probably not to write, at age seven, and in indiana, where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores, for a total of fewer than  months in aggregate by the age of . he persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the king james bible, aesops fables, john bunyans the pilgrims progress, daniel defoes robinson crusoe, and the autobiography of benjamin franklin. despite being selfeducated, lincoln was the recipient of honorary degrees later in life, including an honorary doctor of laws from columbia university in june .

as a teen, lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was . lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax. he was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catchascatchcan style . he became county wrestling champion at the age of . he gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the clarys grove boys.

in march , fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended lincoln family, including abraham, moved west to illinois, a free state, and settled in macon county. abraham then became increasingly distant from thomas, in part due to his fathers lack of education. in , as thomas and other family members prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county, illinois, abraham struck out on his own. he made his home in new salem, illinois, for six years. lincoln and some friends took goods, including live hogs, by flatboat to new orleans, louisiana, where he first witnessed slavery.

speculation persists that lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge, whom he met when he moved to new salem. witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two. rutledge died on august , , most likely of typhoid fever; saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on anns grave, lincoln sunk into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her.in the early s, he met mary owens from kentucky. late in , lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem. owens arrived that november and he courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. on august , , he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.in , lincoln met mary todd in springfield, illinois, and the following year they became engaged. she was the daughter of robert smith todd, a wealthy lawyer and businessman in lexington, kentucky. a wedding set for january , , was canceled at lincolns request, but they reconciled and married on november , , in the springfield mansion of marys sister. while anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, to hell, i suppose. in , the couple bought a house in springfield near his law office. mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. the oldest, robert todd lincoln, was born in  and was the only child to live to maturity. edward baker lincoln , born in , died february , , probably of tuberculosis. lincolns third son, willie lincoln was born on december , , and died of a fever at the white house on february , . the youngest, thomas tad lincoln, was born on april , , and survived his father but died of heart failure at age  on july , . lincoln was remarkably fond of children and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own. in fact, lincolns law partner william h. herndon would grow irritated when lincoln brought his children to the law office. their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior. herndon recounted, i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut. lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.the deaths of their sons, eddie and willie, had profound effects on both parents. lincoln suffered from melancholy, a condition now thought to be clinical depression. later in life, mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and robert committed her for a time to an asylum in .

during  and , lincoln worked at a general store in new salem, illinois. in , he declared his candidacy for the illinois house of representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war. when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with yearold william berry, with whom he purchased a new salem general store on credit. because a license was required to sell customers single beverages, berry obtained bartending licenses for  each for lincoln and himself, and in  the lincolnberry general store became a tavern as well. as licensed bartenders, lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for  cents a pint. they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. but berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and lincoln ended up running the store by himself. although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing lincoln to sell his share.

in his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers, and tossed him. in the campaign, lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he could draw crowds as a raconteur, but lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election. lincoln finished eighth out of  candidates , though he received  of the  votes cast in the new salem precinct.lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer. rather than studying in the office of an established attorney, as was the custom, lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys john todd stuart and thomas drummond, purchased books including blackstones commentaries and chittys pleadings, and read law on his own. he later said of his legal education that i studied with nobody.

lincolns second state house campaign in , this time as a whig, was a success over a powerful whig opponent. then followed his four terms in the illinois house of representatives for sangamon county. he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal, and later was a canal commissioner. he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a free soil stance opposing both slavery and abolition. in , he declared, the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils. he echoed henry clays support for the american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia.he was admitted to the illinois bar on september , , and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john t. stuart, mary todds cousin. lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during crossexaminations and closing arguments. he partnered several years with stephen t. logan, and in  began his practice with william herndon, a studious young man.on january , , abraham lincoln, then twentyeight years old, delivered his first major speech at the lyceum in springfield, illinois, after the murder of newspaper editor elijah parish lovejoy in alton. lincoln warned that no transatlantic military giant could ever crush us as a nation. it cannot come from abroad. if destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher, said lincoln. prior to that, on april , , an innocent black man, francis mcintosh, was burned alive in st. louis, missouri. zann gill describes how these two murders set off a chain reaction that ultimately prompted abraham lincoln to run for president.

true to his record, lincoln professed to friends in  to be an old line whig, a disciple of henry clay. their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.in , lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinois th district seat in the u.s. house of representatives; he was defeated by john j. hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term. lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in  but also won the election. he was the only whig in the illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line. he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department. lincoln teamed with joshua r. giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support.

on foreign and military policy, lincoln spoke against the mexicanamerican war, which he imputed to president james k. polks desire for military glorythat attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood. he supported the wilmot proviso, a failed proposal to ban slavery in any u.s. territory won from mexico.lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions. the war had begun with a killing of american soldiers by mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory, and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellowcitizens on our own soil. lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil. the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers, and it cost lincoln political support in his district. one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln. lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential warmaking powers.lincoln had pledged in  to serve only one term in the house. realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the  presidential election. taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the general land office. the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation. this distant territory was a democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.

in his springfield practice, lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer. twice a year he appeared for  consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts; this continued for  years. lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. as a riverboat man, lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v. rock island bridge company, a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. in , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. the idea was never commercialized, but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent.lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in  cases; he was sole counsel in  cases, of which  were decided in his favor. from  to , one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad. his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe.lincoln argued in an  criminal trial, defending william duff armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker. the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. armstrong was acquitted.leading up to his presidential campaign, lincoln elevated his profile in an  murder case, with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin; harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent, rev. peter cartwright. harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who, as he lay dying of his wounds, confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison. lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay. lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule. instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected, the judge, a democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in harrisons acquittal.

the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slaveholding south and the free north, with the failure of the compromise of , a legislative package designed to address the issue. in his  eulogy for clay, lincoln highlighted the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue. as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, illinois senator stephen a. douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. the legislation alarmed many northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but douglass kansasnebraska act narrowly passed congress in may .lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech of october . lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. he said the kansas act had a declared indifference, but as i must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. i cannot but hate it. i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world.... lincolns attacks on the kansasnebraska act marked his return to political life.nationally, the whigs were irreparably split by the kansasnebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. reflecting on the demise of his party, lincoln wrote in , i think i am a whig, but others say there are no whigs, and that i am an abolitionist.... i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil, liberty, and antislavery democratic party members, lincoln resisted early republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists. lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs, though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement.in , lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansasnebraska act, and in the aftermath, lincoln sought election to the united states senate. at that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. after leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull. trumbull was an antislavery democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery democrats, had vowed not to support any whig. lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate, joel aldrich matteson.

violent political confrontations in kansas continued, and opposition to the kansasnebraska act remained strong throughout the north. as the  elections approached, lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention, which formally established the illinois republican party. the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union. at the june  republican national convention, though lincoln received support to run as vice president, john c. frémont and william dayton comprised the ticket, which lincoln supported throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the knownothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore. buchanan prevailed, while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois, and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois.

dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the missouri compromise. after scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. his petition was denied in dred scott v. sandford . in his opinion, supreme court chief justice roger b. taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution, and that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners property rights. while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the north. lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power. he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

in , douglas was up for reelection in the u.s. senate, and lincoln hoped to defeat him. many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in , and lincolns  campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor. some eastern republicans supported douglas for his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state. many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference. for the first time, illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate, and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.

lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech, with the biblical reference mark , a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing, or all the other. the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion. the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would, in turn, select lincoln or douglas. when informed of lincolns nomination, douglas stated, lincoln is the strong man of the party ... and if i beat him, my victory will be hardly won.the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas. these were the most famous political debates in american history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands. the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that douglas slave power was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal. douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine, in which he said local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. lincolns argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. douglass argument was more legal in nature, claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court as exercised in the dred scott decision.though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected douglas. however, lincolns articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence. in may , lincoln purchased the illinois staatsanzeiger, a germanlanguage newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the states , german americans voted for democrats, but the germanlanguage paper mobilized republican support. in the aftermath of the  election, newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate, rivaled by william h. seward, salmon p. chase, edward bates, and simon cameron. while lincoln was popular in the midwest, he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office. in january , lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy.over the coming months, lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the republican party. however, despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states, he was less appreciated in the east. horace greeley, editor of the new york tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.on february , , powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union, in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong. many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly. but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention. journalist noah brooks reported, no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience.historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. appearing in sewards home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to chase, lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these republican rivals for the nomination. in response to an inquiry about his ambitions, lincoln said, the taste is in my mouth a little.

on may , , the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis, norman judd, leonard swett, and jesse dubois, and lincoln received his first endorsement. exploiting his embellished frontier legend , lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate. in , lincoln described himself i am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes. michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign. at times he was presented as the plaintalking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe, unpolished but trustworthy.on may , at the republican national convention in chicago, lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as seward and chase. a former democrat, hannibal hamlin of maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. lincolns success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. lincolns managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincolns dictate to make no contracts that will bind me.as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government, most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party. throughout the s, lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention; they opposed douglass position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent vice president john c. breckinridge as their candidate. a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee. lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north, while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south.prior to the republican convention, the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the wide awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln.as douglas and the other candidates campaigned, lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party. the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on lincolns life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold ,, copies. though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. in the runup to the election, he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.on november , , lincoln was elected the th president. he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west. no ballots were cast for him in  of the  southern slave states, and he won only two of  counties in all the southern states, an omen of the impending civil war. lincoln received ,, votes, or . of the total in a fourway race, carrying the free northern states, as well as california and oregon. his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had  votes to  for his opponents.

the south was outraged by lincolns election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march . on december , , south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by february , , florida, mississippi, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and texas followed. six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the confederate states of america, and adopted a constitution. the upper south and border states  initially rejected the secessionist appeal. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy, declaring secession illegal. the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february , .attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of freesoil in the territories. lincoln said, i will suffer death before i consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.lincoln supported the corwin amendment to the constitution, which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office. that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed. on march , , in his first inaugural address, lincoln said that, because he holds such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. a few weeks before the war, lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution.on february , , lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield; he would never again return to springfield alive. lincoln traveled east in a special train. due to secessionist plots, a thenunprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train. en route to his inauguration, lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north. the presidentelect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore. on february , , he arrived in disguise in washington, d.c., which was placed under substantial military guard. lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states

apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states, that by the accession of a republican administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. i believe i have no lawful right to do so, and i have no inclination to do so. lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south, stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. this is the only substantial dispute. the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies, but friends. we must not be enemies.... the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. the failure of the peace conference of  signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. by march , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms. meanwhile, lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated. in his second inaugural address, lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.

major robert anderson, commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston, south carolina, sent a request for provisions to washington, and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. on april , , confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight. historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south, and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion.william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war. donald concludes that, his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. but he also vowed not to surrender the forts. the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.on april , lincoln called on the states to send a total of , volunteer troops to recapture forts, protect washington, and preserve the union, which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. this call forced states to choose sides. virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital, despite its exposure to union lines. north carolina, tennessee, and arkansas followed over the following two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland, but did not prevail; kentucky remained neutral. the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the masondixon line to defend the nation.

as states sent union regiments south, on april , baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains. local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials. lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach washington. john merryman, one maryland official hindering the u.s. troop movements, petitioned supreme court chief justice roger b. taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus. in june, in ex parte merryman, taney, not ruling on behalf of the supreme court, issued the writ, believing that article i, section  of the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend it. but lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.

lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy. he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commanderinchief by exercising unprecedented authority. he expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers. lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions. lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.

it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions. copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. on august , , lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates. the law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.in august , general john c. frémont, the  republican presidential nominee, without consulting washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity. as a result, union enlistments from maryland, kentucky, and missouri increased by over ,.internationally, lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy. he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner. in the  trent affair, which threatened war with great britain, the u.s. navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship, the trent, on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered. lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. biographer james g. randall dissected lincolns successful techniques

his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of state departments attitude toward britain, his deference toward seward and sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for americas true position at the same time that satisfaction was given to a friendly country.

lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department. he tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors, and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. in january , after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department, lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton. stanton centralized the war departments activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government ,,. stanton was a staunch unionist, probusiness, conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction. he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official. stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together, say thomas and hyman.lincolns war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was welldefended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory. twice a week, lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard. for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science; halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoinehenri jomini. lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the mississippi river. lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army, rather than merely capturing territory.in directing the unions war strategy, lincoln valued the advice of gen. winfield scott, even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army. on june , , president lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point, where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department.

after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement, lincoln appointed major general george b. mcclellan generalinchief. mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign. mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington. mcclellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capital.

in , lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction. he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia. pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north, thus protecting washington from counterattack. but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of , forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington.despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope, lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington. two days after mcclellans return to command, general robert e. lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland, leading to the battle of antietam. that battle, a union victory, was among the bloodiest in american history; it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january.mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army, while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee. lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans; and after the  midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside. the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part.burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december. desertions during  came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg, so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker.in the  midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market. the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest, but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest, where many southerners had lived for generations.in the spring of  lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond, rosecrans on chattanooga, grant on vicksburg, and a naval assault on charleston.hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may, then resigned and was replaced by george meade. meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign, but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands. at the same time, grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river, splitting the far western rebel states.

the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution, which before  was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states. lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves. lincoln rejected major general john c. frémonts august  emancipation attempt, as well as one by major general david hunter in may , on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede.in june , congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which lincoln signed. in july, the confiscation act of  was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commanderinchief, which he planned to exercise. on july , , lincoln reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet.peace democrats  argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification, but republican editor horace greeley of the newyork tribune, in his public letter, the prayer of twenty millions, implored lincoln to embrace emancipation. in a public letter of august , , lincoln replied to greeley, writing that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the union

my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it, and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it; and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that. what i do about slavery, and the colored race, i do because i believe it helps to save the union; and what i forbear, i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union ...  i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.

on september , , lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation, which announced that, in states still in rebellion on january , , the slaves would be freed. he spent the next  days, between september  and january , preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites. at the same time, during those  days, lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact. but, on january , , keeping his word, lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation, freeing the slaves in  states not then under union control, with exemptions specified for areas under such control. lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was i never, in my life, felt more certain that i was doing right, than i do in signing this paper.with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, union armies advancing south enabled thousands of slaves to escape to freedom. the emancipation proclamation having stated that freedmen would be received into the armed service of the united states, enlisting these freedmen became official policy. by the spring of , lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, lincoln wrote, the bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once. by the end of , at lincolns direction, general lorenzo thomas had enrolled twenty regiments of african americans from the mississippi valley.

lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november , . in  words, and three minutes, lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in , but in , conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.defying his prediction that the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, the address became the most quoted speech in american history.

general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln. responding to criticism of grant after shiloh, lincoln had said, i cant spare this man. he fights. with grant in command, lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander. grant then assumed command of meades army.lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in . he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions, and once assured that he had none, lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general, a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington. authorization for such a promotion with the advice and consent of the senate was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate. his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march , .grant in  waged the bloody overland campaign, which exacted heavy losses on both sides. when lincoln asked what grants plans were, the persistent general replied, i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer. grants army moved steadily south. lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point, virginia, to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman. lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north. lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructureplantations, railroads, and bridgeshoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability. he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction  for its own sake. lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in  when confederate general jubal early raided washington, d.c. legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position, union captain  oliver wendell holmes jr. shouted at him, get down, you damn fool, before you get shot but this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal.as grant continued to weaken lees forces, efforts to discuss peace began. confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln, seward, and others at hampton roads. lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized. on april , , grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege. the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital. on april , lee surrendered to grant at appomattox, officially ending the war.

lincoln ran for reelection in , while uniting the main republican factions, along with war democrats edwin m. stanton and andrew johnson. lincoln used conversation and his patronage powersgreatly expanded from peacetimeto build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him. at its convention, the republicans selected johnson as his running mate. to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans, lincoln ran under the label of the new union party.

grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns reelection prospects, and many republicans feared defeat. lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house; lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. the pledge read as followsthis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected. then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the president elect, as to save the union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.

the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure; but their candidate, mcclellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. meanwhile, lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support. shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism. the democratic party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln. the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation. state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads. on november , lincoln carried all but three states, including  percent of union soldiers.

on march , , lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. in it, he deemed the war casualties to be gods will. historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semisacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world; it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial. lincoln said

fondly do we hopefervently do we praythat this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet, if god wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bondmans  years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said , years ago, so still it must be said, the judgments of the lord, are true and righteous altogether. with malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nations wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphanto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

reconstruction preceded the wars end, as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated, lincoln replied, let em up easy. lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. his main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one. lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals, under rep. thaddeus stevens, sen. charles sumner and sen. benjamin wade, who otherwise remained lincolns allies. determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south, lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. his amnesty proclamation of december , , offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.

as southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. in tennessee and arkansas, lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors. in louisiana, lincoln ordered general nathaniel p. banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when  percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations. the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the  wadedavis bill, which lincoln vetoed. the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana, arkansas, and tennessee.lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals. to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court, he named the radicals choice, salmon p. chase, who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.after implementing the emancipation proclamation, lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december  an amendment was brought to congress. the senate passed it on april , , but the first vote in the house of representatives fell short of the required twothirds majority. passage became part of lincolns reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the house passed on january , . with ratification, it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december , .lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved shortterm military control, pending readmission under the control of southern unionists.historians agree that it is impossible to predict how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived. biographers james g. randall and richard current, according to david lincove, argue that

it is likely that had he lived, lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnsons, that he would have clashed with congressional radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnsons mistakes.

eric foner argues that

unlike sumner and other radicals, lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. he believed, as most republicans did in april , that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forwardlooking former confederates. but time and again during the war, lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans. ... lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death.

lincolns experience with native americans started early with their killing of his grandfather in front of the family. later he served as a captain in the state militia during the black hawk war but saw no combat. during his presidency, his policy toward indians was based on politics. he used appointments to the indian bureau as a reward to supporters from minnesota and wisconsin. while in office his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from indian attacks.on august , , the sioux or dakota uprising broke out in minnesota. hundreds of settlers were killed, , were displaced from their homes, and washington was deeply alarmed. some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier. lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising. when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians, lincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in minnesota. lincoln sent general john pope to minnesota as commander of the new department of the northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities. before he arrived, the fond du lac band of chippewa sent lincoln a letter begging to go to war for the united states against the sioux, so lincoln could send minnesotas troops to fight the south. shortly after, a mille lacs band chief offered the same at st. cloud, minnesota. in it the chippewa specified that they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare. that meant there would be no prisoners of war, no surrender, no peace agreement. lincoln did not accept the chippewa offer, as he had no means to control the outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native american warfare. one of the chippewa signing the letter, chief nawgawnub, had received a presidential medal from lincoln earlier in the year.serving under gen. pope was minnesota congressman henry h. sibley. minnesotas governor had made sibley a colonel united states volunteers to command the us force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated little crows forces at the battle of wood lake. 

the day the mdewakanton force surrendered at camp release, a chippewa war council met at minnesotas capitol with another chippewa offer to lincoln, to fight the sioux. sibley ordered a military commission to review that actions of the captured to try those that had committed war crimes. the legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the mexican war. sibley thought he had  to  of men he wanted for trial while gen. pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried. when it was done,  had been given death sentences that were subject to presidential review. lincoln ordered gen pope send all of the trial transcripts to washington where he and two of his staff pored over the trials. the lawyer in lincoln saw issues. he slowly realized that the trials could be divided into two groups combat between combatants and combat against civilians. the groups could be identified by their transcripts, the first group were all just three pages in length while the second group had more pages, some up to twelve. he placed  cases into the first group and commuted their sentences for the largest mass commutation in history. into the second group went forty. one he commuted for turning states witness. sibley dismissed another when overwhelming proof surfaced exonerating the man. the remaining  were executed in the largest mass hanging in u.s. history. very quickly questions arose concerning three of the executions that have not been answered. less than four months after the executions, lincoln issued general order  that relates more to the minnesota war than the civil war. now a congressman, alexander ramsey told lincoln, in , that he would have gotten more reelection support in minnesota had he executed all  of the mdewakanton. lincoln responded, i could not afford to hang men for votes. the men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at davenport, iowa. a few of those he had released due to the efforts of bishop henry whipple.

lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating. lincoln vetoed only four bills, including the wadedavis bill with its harsh reconstruction program. the  homestead act made millions of acres of western governmentheld land available for purchase at low cost. the  morrill landgrant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. the pacific railway acts of  and  granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in . the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the s.

in the selection and use of his cabinet, lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. lincoln commented on his thought process, we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet. we needed to hold our own people together. i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. then i had no right to deprive the country of their services. goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals.there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs , and a federal income tax. in , lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs, following the first enacted by buchanan. he also signed the revenue act of , creating the first u.s. income taxa flat tax of  percent on incomes above  . the revenue act of  adopted rates that increased with income.the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas. the national banking act created the system of national banks. the us issued paper currency for the first time, known as greenbacksprinted in green on the reverse side. in , congress created the department of agriculture.in response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.

lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday. thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the th century. it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. the prior proclamation had been during james madisons presidency  years earlier. in , lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving.in june , lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park.

lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known. lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court. noah haynes swayne was an antislavery lawyer who was committed to the union. samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the  election and was an avowed abolitionist. david davis was lincolns campaign manager in  and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced. democrat stephen johnson field, a previous california supreme court justice, provided geographic and political balance. finally, lincolns treasury secretary, salmon p. chase, became chief justice. lincoln believed chase was an able jurist, would support reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the republican party.

lincoln named his main political rival, william h. seward, as secretary of state and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio. however, lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy. he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late  to make sure there was no escalation into a war with britain. sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy. he was successful after indicating to britain and france that the union would declare war on them if they supported the south.

john wilkes booth was a wellknown actor and a confederate spy from maryland; though he never joined the confederate army, he had contacts with the confederate secret service. after attending lincolns last public address, on april , , in which lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers, booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president. when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant, he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre. lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april , just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse. at the last minute, grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.on april , , hours before he was assassinated, lincoln signed legislation establishing the united states secret service, and, at  in the evening, booth entered the back of lincolns theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of lincolns head, mortally wounding him. lincolns guest, major henry rathbone, momentarily grappled with booth, but booth stabbed him and escaped. after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors, lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house. after remaining in a coma for eight hours, lincoln died at  in the morning on april . stanton saluted and said, now he belongs to the ages. lincolns body was placed in a flagwrapped coffin, which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers. president johnson was sworn in later that same day.two weeks later, booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in virginia, and was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april . secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive, so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed. after a brief interview, stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge.

the late president lay in state, first in the east room of the white house, and then in the capitol rotunda from april  to . the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train. the train followed a circuitous route from washington d.c. to springfield, illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about lincoln. african americans were especially moved; they had lost their moses. in a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war. historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death. lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb.

as a young man, lincoln was a religious skeptic. he was deeply familiar with the bible, quoting and praising it. he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others. he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs. throughout his public career, lincoln often quoted scripture. his three most famous speechesthe house divided speech, the gettysburg address, and his second inauguraleach contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture.

in the s, lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity, a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power. with the death of his son edward in  he more frequently expressed a dependence on god. he never joined a church, although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in .in the s, lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence. the death of his son willie in february  may have caused him to look toward religion for solace. after willies death, he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity. he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest. yet the contest began. and having begun, he could give the final victory to either side any day. yet the contest proceeds.

lincoln did believe in an allpowerful god that shaped events and by  was expressing that belief in major speeches. by the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on april , , to a newspaper editor in kentucky i claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now, at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. god alone can claim it. whither it is tending seems plain. if god now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god.this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history, and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least. lincoln explains therein that the cause, purpose, and result of the war was gods will. lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical protestants. on the day lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land.

lincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria. he took blue mass pills, which contained mercury, to treat constipation. it is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning.several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination. these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type b.

lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins, harry v. jaffa, vernon burton, eric foner, and herman j. belz. lincoln called the declaration of independencewhich emphasized freedom and equality for allthe sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the s. he did this at a time when the constitution, which tolerated slavery, was the focus of most political discourse. diggins notes, lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the  cooper union speech. instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state. many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.as a whig activist, lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to jacksonian democrats. lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise. nevertheless, lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism. according to historian sean wilentz

just as the republican party of the s absorbed certain elements of jacksonianism, so lincoln, whose whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well. and some of the jacksonian spirit resided inside the lincoln white house.

william c. harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers, the constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism. james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform. randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of socalled radicalism which involved abuse of the south, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.

in lincolns first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural  and other times in the singular. the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century.

in his company, i was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.

in surveys of u.s. scholars ranking presidents conducted since , the top three presidents are lincoln, washington, and franklin delano roosevelt, although the order varies. between  and , lincoln, john f. kennedy, and ronald reagan were the topranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys, according to gallup. a  study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after george washington.lincolns assassination left him a national martyr. he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. republicans linked lincolns name to their party. many, though not all, in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. historians have said he was a classical liberal in the thcentury sense. allen c. guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democratan enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an american counterpart to mill, cobden, and bright, whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office.sociologist barry schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era , when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes, even among white southerners. the high point came in  with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington, d.c.union nationalism, as envisioned by lincoln, helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt, woodrow wilson, and franklin delano roosevelt. in the new deal era, liberals honored lincoln not so much as the selfmade man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state.schwartz argues that in the s and s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life. during the great depression, he argues, lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful. franklin d. roosevelt, preparing america for war, used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan. americans asked, what would lincoln do however, schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance, and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness. he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.in the cold war years, lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes. he had long been known as the great emancipator, but, by the late s, some african american intellectuals, led by lerone bennett jr., denied that lincoln deserved that title. bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in . he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them. defenders of lincoln, such as authors dirck and cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously, pointing to his narrow political agenda and faulty research.by the s, lincoln had become a hero to political conservativesapart from neoconfederates such as mel bradford, who denounced his treatment of the white southfor his intense nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, his acting on lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers. lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world.barry schwartz wrote in  that lincolns image suffered erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule in the late th century. on the other hand, donald opined in his  biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason.in the st century, president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies.lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.lincoln has been also admired by political figures outside the u.s., including german political theorist karl marx, indian independence leader mahatma gandhi, former liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf, and libyan revolutionary muammar gaddafi.

the september  attacks, commonly known as /, were four coordinated islamist suicide terrorist attacks carried out by alqaeda against the united states in . that morning,  terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the new england and midatlantic regions of the east coast to california. the hijackers crashed the first two planes into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city, two of the worlds five tallest buildings at the time, and aimed the next two flights toward targets in or near washington, d.c., in an attack on the nations capital. the third team succeeded in crashing into the pentagon, the headquarters of the u.s. department of defense in arlington county, virginia, while the fourth plane crashed in rural pennsylvania following a passenger revolt. the attacks killed nearly , people and instigated the multidecade global war on terror.

the first impact was that of american airlines flight , which crashed into the north tower of the world trade center complex in lower manhattan at  a.m. sixteen minutes later, at , the world trade centers south tower was hit by united airlines flight . both story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and fortyone minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the wtc complex and damaging or destroying nearby buildings. a third flight, american airlines flight , crashed into the pentagon at  a.m., causing a partial collapse. the fourth and final flight, united airlines flight , flew in the direction of the capital. alerted to the previous attacks, the passengers retaliated in an attempt to take control of the aircraft, forcing the hijackers to crash the plane in a stonycreek township field, near indian lake and shanksville, at  a.m. investigators determined that flight s target was either the united states capitol or the white house.

within hours of the attacks, the central intelligence agency had determined that alqaeda was responsible. the united states formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading afghanistan to depose the taliban, which rejected the conditions of u.s. terms to expel alqaeda from afghanistan and extradite its leaders. the u.s.s invocation of article  of the north atlantic treatyits only usage to datecalled upon allies to fight alqaeda. as u.s. and nato invasion forces swept through afghanistan, alqaeda leader osama bin laden disappeared into the white mountains, eluding captivity by western forces. although bin laden initially denied any involvement, in  he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks. alqaedas cited motivations included u.s. support of israel, the presence of u.s. military bases in saudi arabia and sanctions against iraq. the nearly decadelong manhunt for bin laden concluded on may , , when he was killed during a u.s. military raid after being tracked down to his compound in abbottabad, pakistan. the war in afghanistan continued for another eight years until the agreement was made in february  for american and nato troops to withdraw from the country, and the last members of the u.s. armed forces left the region on august , , resulting in the return to power of the taliban.

not including the hijackers, the attacks killed , people, injured thousands more and gave rise to substantial longterm health consequences while also causing at least  billion in infrastructure and property damage. it remains the deadliest terrorist act in human history as well as the single deadliest incident for both firefighters and law enforcement personnel in the history of the united states, causing the deaths of  and  members respectively. the loss of life stemming from the impact of flight  secured its place as the most lethal plane crash in aviation history followed by the death toll incurred by flight . the destruction of the world trade center and its environs seriously harmed the u.s. economy and induced global market shocks. many other countries strengthened antiterrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. cleanup of the world trade center site  took eight months and was completed in may , while the pentagon was repaired within a year. after delays in the design of a replacement complex, construction of the one world trade center began in november ; it opened in november . memorials to the attacks include the national september  memorial  museum in new york city, the pentagon memorial in arlington county, virginia, and the flight  national memorial at the pennsylvania crash site.

the origins of alqaeda can be traced to , when the soviet union invaded afghanistan. soon after the invasion, osama bin laden traveled to afghanistan and helped organize arab mujahideen  to resist the communist invaders  until their exit from the country in . during that time, bin laden, together with abdullah azzam, formed the maktab alkhidamat  in , an organization to support arab mujahideen who came to join the jihad in afghanistan.the u.s. central intelligence agency  funneled several billion dollars worth of weapons to the indigenous afghan mujahideen resistance, a portion of which bled to the arab volunteers. however, no direct evidence of u.s. aid to bin laden or any of his affiliates was ever uncovered.in , bin laden issued his first fatwā, calling for american soldiers to leave saudi arabia. in a second  fatwā, bin laden outlined his objections to american foreign policy with respect to the state of israel, as well as the continued presence of american troops in saudi arabia after the gulf war. a subscriber to the athari  and wahhabi school of islamic theology, bin laden used islamic quran texts to exhort muslims to attack americans until the stated grievances were reversed. according to bin laden, muslim legal scholars had throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the muslim countries.the hamburg cell in germany included radical islamists who eventually came to be key operatives in the / attacks. mohamed atta; marwan alshehhi; ziad jarrah; ramzi bin alshibh; and said bahaji were all members of alqaedas hamburg cell.

bin laden orchestrated the attacks. he initially denied involvement, but later recanted his false statements. al jazeera broadcast a statement by him on september ,  i stress that i have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation. in november , u.s. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in jalalabad, afghanistan. in the video, bin laden, talking to khaled alharbi, admitted foreknowledge of the attacks. on december , , a second video of bin laden was released in which he, stopping short of admitting responsibility for the attacks, said

it has become clear that the west in general and america in particular have an unspeakable hatred for islam. ... it is the hatred of crusaders. terrorism against america deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing america to stop its support for israel, which kills our people. ... we say that the end of the united states is imminent, whether bin laden or his followers are alive or dead, for the awakening of the muslim ummah nation has occurred. ... it is important to hit the economy , which is the base of its military power...if the economy is hit they will become reoccupied.

shortly before the  u.s. presidential election, bin laden used a taped statement to publicly acknowledge alqaedas involvement in the attacks. he admitted his direct link to the attacks and said they were carried out because

 the events that affected my soul in a direct way started in  when america permitted the israelis to invade lebanon and the american sixth fleet helped them in that. this bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced.

i couldnt forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy...and as i looked at those demolished towers in lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in america in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.

and that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate american policy. destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance. bin laden said that he had personally directed his followers to attack the world trade center and the pentagon. another video obtained by al jazeera in september  showed bin laden with one of the attacks chief planners, ramzi bin alshibh, as well as hijackers, hamza alghamdi and wail alshehri, amidst making preparations for the attacks. bin laden had been on the fbis most wanted list since  for the  bombings of the u.s. embassies in tanzania and kenya.

journalist yosri fouda of the arabic television channel al jazeera reported that in april  alqaeda member khalid sheikh mohammed admitted his involvement in the attacks, along with ramzi bin alshibh. the  / commission report determined that the animosity towards the united states felt by mohammed, the principal architect of the / attacks, stemmed from his violent disagreement with u.s. foreign policy favoring israel. mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the  world trade center bombing and the uncle of ramzi yousef, the lead bomber in that attack. in late , mohammed and yousef moved on to plan a new terrorist attack called the bojinka plot planned for january . despite a failure and yousefs capture by u.s. forces the following month, the bojinka plot would highly influence the later / attacks.in substitution for testimony of khalid sheikh mohammed from the trial of zacarias moussaoui, five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operations details. they are bin laden; khalid sheikh mohammed; ramzi bin alshibh; abu turab alurduni; and mohammed atef.

osama bin ladens declaration of a holy war against the united states, and a  fatwā signed by bin laden and others, calling for the killing of americans, are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation.in bin ladens november  letter to america, he explicitly stated that alqaedas motives for the attacks included

u.s. support of israel

to support and globally expand the alaqsa intifada

the attacks against muslims in somalia

support of the philippines against muslims in the moro conflict

support for israeli aggression against muslims in lebanon

support of russian atrocities against muslims in chechnya

proamerican governments in the middle east  being against muslim interests

support of indian oppression against muslims in kashmir

the presence of u.s. troops in saudi arabia

the sanctions against iraq

environmental destruction

after the attacks, bin laden and ayman alzawahiri released additional videotapes and audio recordings, some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks. two particularly important publications were bin ladens  letter to america and a  videotape by bin laden.bin laden interpreted muhammad as having banned the permanent presence of infidels in arabia. in , bin laden issued a fatwā calling for american troops to leave saudi arabia. in , alqaeda wrote for over seven years the united states has been occupying the lands of islam in the holiest of places, the arabian peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring muslim peoples.in a december  interview, bin laden said he felt that americans were too near to mecca, and considered this a provocation to the entire muslim world. one analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without u.s. troops in saudi arabia, alqaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions.in the  fatwā, alqaeda identified the iraq sanctions as a reason to kill americans, condemning the protracted blockade among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against allah, his messenger, and muslims. the fatwā declared that the ruling to kill the americans and their allies  civilians and military  is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the alaqsa mosque and the holy mosque of mecca from their grip, and in order for their the americans armies to move out of all the lands of islam, defeated and unable to threaten any muslim.in , bin laden claimed that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in , when he witnessed israels bombardment of highrise apartment buildings during the  lebanon war. some analysts, including political scientists john mearsheimer and stephen walt, also claimed that u.s. support of israel was one motive for the attacks. in  and , bin laden again connected the september  attacks with u.s. support of israel, although most of the letter expressed bin ladens disdain for president bush and bin ladens hope to destroy and bankrupt the u.s.other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin laden and alqaeda. some authors suggested the humiliation that resulted from the islamic world falling behind the western world  this discrepancy was rendered especially visible by globalization and a desire to provoke the u.s. into a broader war against the islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support alqaeda. similarly, others have argued that / was a strategic move with the objective of provoking america into a war that would incite a panislamic revolution.documents seized during the  operation that killed bin laden included a few notes handwritten by bin laden in september  with the heading the birth of the idea of september . in these notes he describes how he was inspired by the crash of egyptair flight  on october , , which was deliberately crashed by copilot gameel albatouti. this is how the idea of / was conceived and developed in my head, and that is when we began the planning bin laden continued, adding that no one but abu hafs and abu alkhair knew about it at the time. the / commission report identified khalid sheikh mohammed as the architect of /, but he is not mentioned in bin ladens notes.

the attacks were conceived by khalid sheikh mohammed, who first presented it to osama bin laden in . at that time, bin laden and alqaeda were in a period of transition, having just relocated back to afghanistan from sudan. the  african embassy bombings and bin ladens february  fatwā marked a turning point of alqaedas terrorist operation, as bin laden became intent on attacking the united states.

in late  or early , bin laden gave approval for mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot. mohammed, bin laden, and mohammed atef, the deputy of bin laden, held a series of meetings in early . atef provided operational support, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. bin laden overruled mohammed, rejecting potential targets such as the u.s. bank tower in los angeles for lack of time.bin laden provided leadership and financial support and was involved in selecting participants. he initially selected nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar, both experienced jihadists who had fought in bosnia. hazmi and mihdhar arrived in the united states in midjanuary . in early , hazmi and mihdhar took flying lessons in san diego, california. both spoke little english, performed poorly in flying lessons, and eventually served as secondary muscle hijackers.in late , a group of men from hamburg, germany, arrived in afghanistan. the group included mohamed atta, marwan alshehhi, ziad jarrah, and ramzi bin alshibh. bin laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak english, and had experience living in the west. new recruits were routinely screened for special skills and alqaeda leaders consequently discovered that hani hanjour already had a commercial pilots license. mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in western clothing.hanjour arrived in san diego on december , , joining hazmi. they soon left for arizona, where hanjour took refresher training. marwan alshehhi arrived at the end of may , while atta arrived on june , , and jarrah arrived on june , . bin alshibh applied several times for a visa to the united states, but as a yemeni, he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa., bin alshibh stayed in hamburg, providing coordination between atta and mohammed. the three hamburg cell members all took pilot training in south florida at huffman aviation.in the spring of , the secondary hijackers began arriving in the united states. in july , atta met with bin alshibh in tarragona, catalonia, spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. bin alshibh also passed along bin ladens wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible. some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt saudi officials who were family members or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.there have been a few theories that / was selected by the hijackers as the date of the attack because of its resemblance to , the phone number used to report emergencies in the united states. however, lawrence wright wrote that the hijackers chose the date when john iii sobieski, the king of poland and grand duke of lithuania, began the battle that turned back the ottoman empires muslim armies that were attempting to capture vienna  on  september . during , vienna was the seat of the holy roman empire and habsburg monarchy, both major powers in europe at the time. for osama bin laden, this was a date when the west gained some dominance over islam, and by attacking on this date, he hoped to make a step in islam winning the war for worldwide power and influence.

in late , alqaeda associate walid bin attash  contacted mihdhar, telling him to meet him in kuala lumpur, malaysia; hazmi and abu bara al yemeni would also be in attendance. the nsa intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, mihdhar, and the name nawaf . while the agency feared something nefarious might be afoot, it took no further action.

the cia had already been alerted by saudi intelligence about the status of mihdhar and hazmi as alqaeda members, and a cia team broke into mihdhars dubai hotel room and discovered that mihdhar had a u.s. visa. while alec station alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact, it did not share this information with the fbi. the malaysian special branch observed the january , , meeting of the two alqaeda members and informed the cia that mihdhar, hazmi, and khallad were flying to bangkok, but the cia never notified other agencies of this, nor did it ask the state department to put mihdhar on its watchlist. an fbi liaison to alec station asked permission to inform the fbi of the meeting but was told this is not a matter for the fbi.by late june, senior counterterrorism official richard clarke and cia director george tenet were convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come, although the cia believed the attacks would likely occur in saudi arabia or israel. in early july, clarke put domestic agencies on full alert, telling them something really spectacular is going to happen here. soon. he asked the fbi and the state department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the defense department to go to threat condition delta. clarke later wrote somewhere in cia there was information that two known al qaeda terrorists had come into the united states. somewhere in fbi, there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the united states ... they had specific information about individual terrorists from which one could have deduced what was about to happen. none of that information got to me or the white house.on july , tom wilshire, a cia agent assigned to the fbis international terrorism division, emailed his superiors at the cias counterterrorism center  requesting permission to inform the fbi that hazmi was in the country and that mihdhar had a u.s. visa. the cia never responded.the same day in july, margarette gillespie, an fbi analyst working in the ctc, was told to review material about the malaysia meeting. she was not told of the participants presence in the u.s. the cia gave gillespie surveillance photos of mihdhar and hazmi from the meeting to show to fbi counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. the intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting with criminal investigators. when shown the photos, the fbi were refused more details on their significance, and they were not given mihdhars date of birth nor passport number. in late august , gillespie told the ins, the state department, the customs service, and the fbi to put hazmi and mihdhar on their watchlists, but the fbi was prohibited from using criminal agents in searching for the duo, hindering their efforts.also in july, a phoenixbased fbi agent sent a message to fbi headquarters, alec station, and fbi agents in new york alerting them to the possibility of a coordinated effort by osama bin laden to send students to the united states to attend civil aviation universities and colleges. the agent, kenneth williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all arab students seeking flight training. in july, jordan alerted the u.s. that alqaeda was planning an attack on the u.s.; months later, jordan notified the u.s. that the attacks codename was the big wedding and that it involved airplanes.on august , , the cias presidential daily brief , designated for the president only, was entitled bin ladin determined to strike in us. the memo noted that fbi information indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.in midaugust, one minnesota flight school alerted the fbi about zacarias moussaoui, who had asked suspicious questions. the fbi found that moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to pakistan, and the ins arrested him for overstaying his french visa. their request to search his laptop was denied by fbi headquarters due to the lack of probable cause.the failures in intelligencesharing were attributed to  justice department policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with cia and nsa reluctance to reveal sensitive sources and methods such as tapped phones. testifying before the / commission in april , then  attorney general john ashcroft recalled that the single greatest structural cause for the september th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents. clarke also wrote there were... failures to get information to the right place at the right time.

early on the morning of september , , nineteen hijackers took control of four commercial airliners  en route to california  after takeoffs from logan international airport in boston, massachusetts; newark liberty international airport in newark, new jersey; and washington dulles international airport in loudoun and fairfax counties in virginia. large planes with long coasttocoast flights were selected for hijacking because they would have more fuel.the four flights were

 eastern daylight time  excluding hijackers including emergency workers including hijackers

at  a.m., american airlines flight  took off from logan international airport in boston. fifteen minutes into the flight, five hijackers armed with boxcutters took over the plane, injuring at least three people  before forcing their way into the cockpit. the terrorists also displayed an apparent explosive device in order to frighten the hostages into submission, while additionally spraying mace into the cabin to further hinder any efforts to resist. back at logan, united airlines flight  took off at  a.m., approximately the same time as flight s hijacking. hundreds of miles southwest at dulles international airport in fairfax and loudoun counties, virginia, american airlines flight  left the runway at  a.m. flight s journey proceeded normally for  minutes until  a.m., when another group of five hijacked the plane, murdering both pilots and stabbing several crew members before assuming control of the aircraft. as was the case with flight , the hijackers used bomb threats to instill fear into the passengers and crew and sprayed chemical weapons to disable any opposition. concurrently, united airlines flight  departed from newark international airport in new jersey; originally scheduled to pull away from the gate at  a.m., the plane was running  minutes late.

at  a.m., flight  became the first plane to reach its target when it was deliberately crashed into the north face of the world trade centers north tower , although the initial presumption by many was that this was merely an accident. at  a.m., shortly after the north tower was struck and only minutes following the hijacking of flight , american airlines flight  was also taken over by another group of five who forcibly entered the cockpit  minutes after takeoff. although the hijackers were equipped with knives, there were no reports of anyone on board actually being stabbed unlike the first two planes, nor did the two people who made phone calls mention the use of mace or a bomb threat of any kind. seventeen minutes after the first plane crashed into the north tower, flight  was flown into the south towers southern facade  at  a.m., instantly proving to the entire world that the first crash was not an accident but that a terrorist attack was underway. after waiting  minutes to make their movea holdup that proved disastrous for the terrorists when combined with the delayed takeoff from the runwayfour men aboard flight  struck suddenly, killing at least one passenger before storming the cockpit and seizing control of the plane at  a.m., turning the plane eastbound and setting course for washington, d.c. much like their counterparts on the first two flights, the fourth team also used bomb threats to get their way and again filled the cabin with mace. nine minutes after flight s hijacking, flight  was crashed into the west side of the pentagon. because of the two delays, the passengers and crew of flight  had time to be made aware of the previous attacks through phone calls to the ground. knowing their lives were forfeited rendered the bomb threat moot, and an uprising was hastily organized in the hopes of taking control of the aircraft, with an assault on the hijackers being launched at  a.m. within minutes, they had fought their way to the front of the cabin and began breaking down the cockpit door. fearing their captives would gain the upper hand, the hijackers rolled the plane and pitched it into a nosedive, crashing into a field near shanksville, pennsylvania, southeast of pittsburgh, at  a.m. the plane was around twenty minutes away from reaching d.c. at the time of the crash, and its target is believed to have been either the capitol building or the white house.some passengers and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin air phone service and mobile phones provided details several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. according to the / commissions final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multifunction hand tools and assorted leathermantype utility knives with locking blades , but were not found among the possessions left behind by the hijackers. a flight attendant on flight , a passenger on flight , and passengers on flight  said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake. the fbi found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the / commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake. on at least two of the hijacked flights  american  and united   the terrorists tried to ensure nobody would resist by claiming over the pa system that they were taking hostages and were returning to the airport to have a ransom demand met, an obvious attempt to deceive those onboard into staying put by way of a false hope. both of these attempts fell on deaf ears, however, as the hijacker pilots in both instances  keyed the wrong switch and mistakenly transmitted their messages to atc instead of the people on the plane as intended, in the process tipping off the flight controllers that the planes had been hijacked.

three buildings in the world trade center collapsed due to fireinduced structural failure. although the south tower was struck  minutes after the north tower, the planes impact zone was far lower, at a much faster speed, and into a corner, with the unevenlybalanced additional structural weight causing it to collapse first at  a.m., having burned for  minutes in the fire caused by the crash of united airlines flight  and the explosion of its fuel. the north tower lasted another  minutes before collapsing at  a.m., one hour and fortytwo minutes after being struck by american airlines flight . when the north tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby  world trade center building , damaging the building and starting fires. these fires burned for nearly seven hours, compromising the buildings structural integrity, and  wtc collapsed at  p.m. the west side of the pentagon sustained significant damage.

at  a.m., the federal aviation administration  grounded all civilian aircraft within the continental u.s., and civilian aircraft already in flight were told to land immediately. all international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in canada or mexico, and were banned from landing on united states territory for three days. the attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, one of the most prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the u.s. state departments headquarters in washington, d.c. another jet  was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in cleveland, ohio.in an april  interview, khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi bin alshibh, who are believed to have organized the attacks, said flight s intended target was the united states capitol, not the white house. during the planning stage of the attacks, mohamed atta  thought the white house might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from hani hanjour . mohammed said alqaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the world trade center and the pentagon, but decided against it, fearing things could get out of control. final decisions on targets, according to mohammed, were left in the hands of the pilots. if any pilot could not reach his intended target, he was to crash the plane.

in new york city, the attack on the world trade centers north tower singlehandedly made / the deadliest act of terrorism in world history. our world in data described it as the deadliest terrorist act in human history.  taken together, the four crashes caused the deaths of , people  and injured thousands more. the death toll included  on the four planes ; , in the world trade center and in the surrounding area; and  at the pentagon. most who died were civilians; the rest included  firefighters,  law enforcement officers,  military personnel, and the  terrorists. after new york, new jersey lost the most state citizens. more than  countries lost citizens in the attacks.in new york city, more than  of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. in the north tower, between , and , people were at, above or one floor below the point of impact and all died. hundreds were killed instantly the moment the plane struck. the estimated  people who survived the impact were trapped and died in the fires or from smoke inhalation; fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames; or were killed in the buildings collapse. the destruction of all three staircases in the north tower when flight  hit made it impossible for anyone from the impact zone upward to escape.  people not trapped by the impact died. when the plane struck between floors  and , the nd floor was also rendered inescapable when the crash severed all elevator shafts while debris falling from the impact zone blocked the stairwells, ensuring the deaths of all  workers on the final floor below the point of impact.

in the south tower, around  people were on or above the th floor when flight  struck and few survived. as with the north tower, hundreds were killed at the moment of impact. however, unlike those in the north tower, the estimated  survivors of the crash were not technically trapped by the damage done by flight s impact, but most were either unaware that a means of escape still existed or were unable to use it. one stairway, stairwell a, narrowly avoided being destroyed as flight  crashed through the building, allowing  people located on the floors of impact  and four more from the floors above to escape. new york city  operators who received calls from people inside the tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded and as a result, told callers not to descend the tower on their own. in total,  people died in the south tower, fewer than half the number killed in the north tower. of the  people witnessed jumping or falling to their deaths that morning, only three recorded sightings were from the south tower. casualties in the south tower were significantly reduced because some occupants decided to leave the building immediately following the first crash, and because eric eisenberg, an executive at aon insurance, made the decision to evacuate the floors occupied by aon  in the moments following the impact of flight . the minute gap allowed over  of the , aon employees present onsite to evacuate from above the th floor before the south tower was struck; eisenberg was among the nearly  who did not escape. similar preimpact evacuations were carried out by companies such as fiduciary trust, csc, and euro brokers, all of whom had offices on floors above the point of impact. the failure to order a full evacuation of the south tower after the first plane crash into the north tower was described by usa today as one of the days great tragedies.as exemplified in the photograph the falling man, more than  people fell to their deaths from the burning towers, most of whom were forced to jump in order to escape the extreme heat, fire and smoke. some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in the hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. no plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment, thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.at the world trade center complex, a total of  emergency workers died as they tried to rescue people and fight fires, while another law enforcement officer was separately killed onboard united  as it crashed. the new york city fire department  lost  firefighters, including a chaplain and two paramedics. the new york city police department  lost  officers. the port authority police department  lost  officers. eight emergency medical technicians  and paramedics from private emergency medical services  units were killed. almost all of the emergency personnel who died at the scene that day were killed as a result of the towers collapsing, with the exception of one who died when a civilian who fell from the upper floors of the south tower landed on him.cantor fitzgerald l.p.  lost  employees, considerably more than any other employer. marsh inc., located immediately below cantor fitzgerald on floors , lost  employees, and  employees of aon corporation were also killed. the national institute of standards and technology  estimated that about , civilians were in the world trade center complex at the time of the attacks. turnstile counts from the port authority suggest , people were typically in the twin towers by  a.m. most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.in arlington county, virginia,  pentagon workers died when flight  crashed into the buildings western side.  were civilians and  were military personnel, many of whom worked for the united states army or the united states navy. the army lost  civilian employees; six civilian contractors; and  soldiers, while the navy lost six civilian employees; three civilian contractors; and  sailors. seven defense intelligence agency  civilian employees died, and one office of the secretary of defense  contractor. lieutenant general timothy maude, an army deputy chief of staff, was the highestranking military official killed at the pentagon.weeks after the attack, the death toll was estimated to be over ,, more than twice the number of deaths eventually confirmed. the city was only able to identify remains for about , of the world trade center victims. the medical examiners office collected about , unidentified bone and tissue fragments that cannot be matched to the list of the dead. bone fragments were still being found in  by workers who were preparing to demolish the damaged deutsche bank building.

in , a team of anthropologists and archaeologists searched for human remains and personal items at the fresh kills landfill, where  more human remains were recovered, bringing the total found to ,. dna profiling continues in an attempt to identify additional victims. the remains are being held in storage in memorial park, outside the new york city medical examiners facilities. it was expected that the remains would be moved in  to a repository behind a wall at the / museum.in july , a team of scientists at the office of chief medical examiner continued efforts to identify remains, in the hope that improved technology will allow them to identify other victims. in august , the ,st victim was identified as a result of newly available dna technology, and a ,nd during july . three more victims were identified in october , two in september  and an additional two in september . as of november , , victims remain unidentified, amounting to  of the deaths in the world trade center attacks. on september , , the fdny reported that with the death of emt hilda vannata and retired firefighter robert fulco, marking the nd and rd deaths from /related illnesses, the department had now lost the same number of firefighters, emts, and civilian members to /related illnesses as it did on the day of the attacks.

along with the floor twin towers, numerous other buildings at the world trade center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including wtc buildings  through  and st. nicholas greek orthodox church. the north tower, south tower, the marriott hotel , and  wtc were destroyed. the u.s. customs house ,  world trade center,  world trade center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. the deutsche bank building  on  liberty street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in . the two buildings of the world financial center also suffered damage. the last fires at the world trade center site were extinguished on december , exactly  days after the attacks.the deutsche bank building across liberty street from the world trade center complex was later condemned as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the office tower, and was deconstructed. the borough of manhattan community colleges fiterman hall at  west broadway was condemned due to extensive damage from the attacks, and was reopened in .

other neighboring buildings  suffered major damage but have been restored. world financial center buildings, one liberty plaza, the millenium hilton, and  church street had moderate damage and have since been restored. communications equipment on top of the north tower was also destroyed, with only wcbstv maintaining a backup transmitter on the empire state building, but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals and resume their broadcasts.the path train systems world trade center station was located under the complex. as a result, the entire station was demolished completely when the towers collapsed, and the tunnels leading to exchange place station in jersey city, new jersey, were flooded with water. the station was rebuilt as the  billion world trade center transportation hub, which reopened in march . the cortlandt street station on the new york city subways irt broadwayseventh avenue line was also in close proximity to the world trade center complex, and the entire station, along with the surrounding track, was reduced to rubble. the latter station was rebuilt and reopened to the public on september , .the pentagon was severely damaged by the impact of american airlines flight  and the ensuing fires, causing one section of the building to collapse. as the airplane approached the pentagon, its wings knocked down light poles and its right engine hit a power generator before crashing into the western side of the building. the plane hit the pentagon at the firstfloor level. the front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact, while the mid and tail sections kept moving for another fraction of a second. debris from the tail section penetrated the furthest into the building, breaking through  feet  of the three outermost of the buildings five rings.

the new york city fire department  deployed more than  units  to the world trade center. their efforts were supplemented by numerous offduty firefighters and emergency medical technicians. the new york city police department  sent its emergency service units and other police personnel and deployed its aviation unit. the nypd aviation unit assessed the situation and decided that helicopter rescues from the towers were not feasible. numerous police officers of the port authority police department  also participated in rescue efforts. once on the scene, the fdny, the nypd, and the papd did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians.as conditions deteriorated, the nypd aviation unit relayed information to police commanders, who issued orders for its personnel to evacuate the towers; most nypd officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed. with separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies, warnings were not passed along to fdny commanders.after the first tower collapsed, fdny commanders issued evacuation warnings. due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters never heard the evacuation orders.  dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene.

the / attacks resulted in immediate responses to the event, including domestic reactions; closings and cancellations; hate crimes; muslimamerican responses to the event; international responses to the attack; and military responses to the events. an extensive compensation program was quickly established by congress in the aftermath to compensate the victims and families of victims of the / attacks as well.

at  a.m., faa officials were notified flight  had been hijacked and they, in turn, notified the north american aerospace defense command . norad scrambled two fs from otis air national guard base in massachusetts and they were airborne by  a.m. because of slow and confused communication from faa officials, norad had nine minutes notice, and no notice about any of the other flights before they crashed.

after both of the twin towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from langley air force base in virginia at  a.m. at  a.m., vice president dick cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. these instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.for the first time in u.s. history, the emergency preparedness plan called security control of air traffic and air navigation aids  was invoked, thus stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the world. ben sliney, in his first day as the national operations manager of the faa, ordered that american airspace would be closed to all international flights, causing about  flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries. canada received  of the diverted flights and launched operation yellow ribbon to deal with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers.the / attacks had immediate effects on the american people. police and rescue workers from around the country took a leave of absence from their jobs and traveled to new york city to help recover bodies from the twisted remnants of the twin towers. blood donations across the u.s. surged in the weeks after /.the deaths of adults in the attacks resulted in over , children losing a parent. subsequent studies documented childrens reactions to these actual losses and to feared losses of life, the protective environment in the attacks aftermath, and the effects on surviving caregivers.

following the attacks, president george w. bushs approval rating soared to . on september , , he addressed the nation and a joint session of congress regarding the events of september  and the subsequent nine days of rescue and recovery efforts, and described his intended response to the attacks. new york city mayor rudy giulianis highly visible role won him high praise in new york and nationally.many relief funds were immediately set up to assist the attacks victims, with the task of providing financial assistance to the survivors of the attacks and to the victims families. by the deadline for victims compensation on september , , , applications had been received from the families of those who were killed.contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders were implemented soon after the attacks. congress was not told that the united states had been under a continuity of government status until february .in the largest restructuring of the u.s. government in contemporary history, the united states enacted the homeland security act of , creating the u.s. department of homeland security. congress also passed the usa patriot act, saying it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes. civil liberties groups have criticized the patriot act, saying it allows law enforcement to invade citizens privacy and that it eliminates judicial oversight of law enforcement and domestic intelligence.in an effort to effectively combat future acts of terrorism, the national security agency  was given broad powers. nsa commenced warrantless surveillance of telecommunications, which was sometimes criticized since it permitted the agency to eavesdrop on telephone and email communications between the united states and people overseas without a warrant. in response to requests by various intelligence agencies, the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court permitted an expansion of powers by the u.s. government in seeking, obtaining, and sharing information on u.s. citizens as well as nonu.s. people from around the world.

six days after the attacks, president bush made a public appearance at washington, d.c.s largest islamic center and acknowledged the incredibly valuable contribution that millions of american muslims made to their country and called for them to be treated with respect. numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against muslims and south asians were reported in the days following the attacks.sikhs were also subject to targeting due to the use of turbans in the sikh faith, which are stereotypically associated with muslims. there were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings , and assaults on individuals, including one murder balbir singh sodhi, a sikh mistaken for a muslim, who was fatally shot on september , , in mesa, arizona. two dozen members of osama bin ladens family were urgently evacuated out of the country on a private charter plane under fbi supervision three days after the attacks.according to an academic study, people perceived to be middle eastern were as likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of islam during this time. the study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as muslims, arabs, and others thought to be of middle eastern origin. a report by the south asian american advocacy group known as south asian americans leading together documented media coverage of  bias incidents against americans of south asian or middle eastern descent between september  and , . various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented. women wearing hijab were also targeted.

a poll of arabamericans, conducted in may , found that  had personally experienced discrimination since september . a july  poll of muslim americans found that  believed their lives had changed for the worse since september , and  had experienced an act of bias or discrimination.following the september  attacks, many pakistani americans identified themselves as indians to avoid potential discrimination and obtain jobs .by may , there were  complaints of employment discrimination reported to the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission .  of those were complaints from people fired from their jobs. similarly, by june , the u.s. department of transportation  had investigated  september threlated complaints from airline passengers purporting that their religious or ethnic appearance caused them to be singled out at security screenings. dot investigated an additional  complaints from people who alleged they were completely blocked from boarding airplanes on the same grounds.

muslim organizations in the united states were swift to condemn the attacks and called upon muslim americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families. these organizations included the islamic society of north america, american muslim alliance, american muslim council, council on americanislamic relations, islamic circle of north america, and the sharia scholars association of north america. along with monetary donations, many islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance, food, and shelter for victims.

curiosity about islam increased after the attacks. as a result, many mosques and islamic centers began holding open houses and participating in outreach efforts to educate nonmuslims about the faith. in the first  years after the attacks, interfaith community service increased from  to  percent and the percentage of u.s. congregations involved in interfaith worship doubled from  to  percent.

the attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide. across the globe, nations offered proamerican support and solidarity. leaders in most middle eastern countries, as well as libya and afghanistan, condemned the attacks. iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that, the american cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity. the government of saudi arabia officially condemned the attacks, but privately many saudis favored bin ladens cause.although palestinian authority  president yasser arafat also condemned the attacks, there were reports of celebrations of disputed size in the west bank, gaza strip, and east jerusalem. palestinian leaders discredited news broadcasters that justified the attacks or showed celebrations, and the authority claimed such celebrations do not represent the palestinians sentiment, adding that it would not allow a few kids to smear the real face of the palestinians. footage by cnn and other news outlets were suggested by a report originating at a brazilian university to be from ; this was later proven to be a false accusation, resulting in a statement being issued by cnn. as in the united states, the aftermath of the attacks saw tensions increase in other countries between muslims and nonmuslims.united nations security council resolution  condemned the attacks and expressed readiness to take all necessary steps to respond and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with their charter. numerous countries introduced antiterrorism legislation and froze bank accounts they suspected of alqaeda ties. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in a number of countries arrested alleged terrorists.british prime minister tony blair said britain stood shoulder to shoulder with the united states. a few days later, blair flew to washington, d.c., to affirm british solidarity with the united states. in a speech to congress nine days after the attacks, which blair attended as a guest, president bush declared america has no truer friend than great britain. subsequently, prime minister blair embarked on two months of diplomacy to rally international support for military action; he held  meetings with world leaders and traveled more than , miles .the u.s. set up the guantanamo bay detention camp to hold inmates they defined as illegal enemy combatants. the legitimacy of these detentions has been questioned by the european union and human rights organizations.on september , , irans fifth president, mohammad khatami, meeting british foreign secretary jack straw, said iran fully understands the feelings of the americans about the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september . he said although the american administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in iran , the iranians felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities. he also stated that nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.according to radio fardas website, when the news of the attacks was released, some iranian citizens gathered in front of the embassy of switzerland in tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the united states in iran , to express their sympathy, and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. this piece of news at radio fardas website also states that in , on the anniversary of the attacks, the united states department of state published a post at its blog, in which the department thanked the iranian people for their sympathy and stated that it would never forget iranian peoples kindness on those harsh days. after the attacks, both the president and the supreme leader of iran, condemned the attacks. the bbc and time magazine published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by iranian citizens on their websites. according to politico magazine, following the attacks, ali khamenei, the supreme leader of iran, suspended the usual death to america chants at friday prayers temporarily.in september , shortly after the attacks, some fans of aek athens burned an israeli flag and unsuccessfully tried to burn an american flag. though the american flag did not catch fire, the fans booed during a moment of silence for victims of the attacks.

at  p.m. on september , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld was issuing rapid orders to his aides to look for evidence of iraqi involvement. according to notes taken by senior policy official stephen cambone, rumsfeld asked for, best info fast. judge whether good enough hit s.h. saddam hussein at same time. not only ubl osama bin laden. cambones notes quoted rumsfeld as saying, need to move swiftly  near term target needs  go massive  sweep it all up. things related and not.in a meeting at camp david on september  the bush administration rejected the idea of attacking iraq in response to the september  attacks. nonetheless, they later invaded the country with allies, citing saddam husseins support for terrorism. at the time, as many as seven in ten americans believed the iraqi president played a role in the / attacks. three years later, bush conceded that he had not.the nato council declared that the terrorist attacks on the united states were an attack on all nato nations that satisfied article  of the nato charter. this marked the first invocation of article , which had been written during the cold war with an attack by the soviet union in mind. australian prime minister john howard, who was in washington, d.c., during the attacks, invoked article iv of the anzus treaty. the bush administration announced a war on terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin laden and alqaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. these goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.on september , , the u.s. congress passed the authorization for use of military force against terrorists. it is still in effect, and grants the president the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those whom he determined planned, authorized, committed or aided the september  attacks or who harbored said persons or groups.on october , , the war in afghanistan began when u.s. and british forces initiated aerial bombing campaigns targeting taliban and alqaeda camps, then later invaded afghanistan with ground troops of the special forces. this eventually led to the overthrow of the talibans rule of afghanistan with the fall of kandahar on december , , by u.s.led coalition forces.

alqaeda leader osama bin laden, who went into hiding in the white mountains, was targeted by u.s. coalition forces in the battle of tora bora, but he escaped across the pakistani border and would remain out of sight for almost ten years. in an interview with tayseer allouni in  october , bin laden stated the events proved the extent of terrorism that america exercises in the world. bush stated that the world has to be divided in two bush and his supporters, and any country that doesnt get into the global crusade is with the terrorists. what terrorism is clearer than this many governments were forced to support this new terrorism... america wouldnt live in security until we live it truly in palestine. this showed the reality of america, which puts israels interest above its own peoples interest. america wont get out of this crisis until it gets out of the arabian peninsula, and until it stops its support of israel.

the philippines and indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts with islamic terrorism, also increased their military readiness. the military forces of the united states of america and the islamic republic of iran cooperated with each other to overthrow the taliban regime, which had had conflicts with the government of iran. irans quds force helped u.s. forces and afghan rebels in the  uprising in herat.

hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than , contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across lower manhattan due to the twin towers collapse. exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. the bush administration ordered the environmental protection agency  to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the epa did not determine that air quality had returned to preseptember  levels until june .health effects extended to residents, students, and office workers of lower manhattan and nearby chinatown. several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims names were included in the world trade center memorial. approximately , people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust. there is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. a study of rescue workers released in april  found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that  were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.years after the attacks, legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system. on october , , a federal judge rejected new york citys refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. christine todd whitman, administrator of the epa in the attacks aftermath, was heavily criticized by a u.s. district judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. mayor giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater wall street area.on december , , the united states congress passed the james l. zadroga / health and compensation act, which president barack obama signed into law on january , . it allocated . billion to create the world trade center health program, which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from longterm health problems related to the / attacks. the wtc health program replaced preexisting /related health programs such as the medical monitoring and treatment program and the wtc environmental health center program.in , the nypd confirmed that  nypd police officers had died due to /related illnesses. in september , the fdny confirmed that the total number of firefighters that died due to /related illnesses was . both agencies believe that the death toll will rise dramatically in the coming years. the port authority of new york and new jersey police department , the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the world trade center due to the port authority of new york and new jersey owning the site confirmed that four of its police officers have died of /related illnesses. the chief of the papd at the time, joseph morris, made sure that industrialgrade respirators were provided to all papd police officers within  hours and decided that the same  to  police officers would be stationed at the world trade center pile, drastically lowering the number of total papd personnel who would be exposed to the air. the fdny and nypd had rotated hundreds, if not thousands, of different personnel from all over new york city to the pile, which exposed many of them to dust that would give them cancer or other diseases years or decades later. also, they werent given adequate respirators and breathing equipment that could have prevented future diseases.

the attacks had a significant economic impact on united states and world markets. the stock exchanges did not open on september  and remained closed until september . reopening, the dow jones industrial average  fell  points, or ., to , a recordsetting oneday point decline. by the end of the week, the djia had fallen ,. points , at the time its largest oneweek point drop in history. in  dollars, u.s. stocks lost . trillion in valuation for the week.in new york city, about , jobmonths and . billion in wages were lost in the first three months after the attacks. the economic effects were mainly on the economys export sectors. the citys gdp was estimated to have declined by . billion for the last three months of  and all of . the u.s. government provided . billion in immediate assistance to the government of new york city in september , and . billion in early  for economic development and infrastructure needs.also hurt were small businesses in lower manhattan near the world trade center , resulting in lost jobs and their consequent wages. assistance was provided by small business administration loans; federal government community development block grants; and economic injury disaster loans. some ,, square feet  of lower manhattan office space was damaged or destroyed. many wondered whether these jobs would return, and if the damaged tax base would recover. studies of /s economic effects show the manhattan office realestate market and office employment were less affected than first feared, because of the financial services industrys need for facetoface interaction.north american air space was closed for several days after the attacks and air travel decreased upon its reopening, leading to a nearly  cutback in air travel capacity, and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling u.s. airline industry.the september  attacks also led to the u.s. wars in afghanistan and iraq, as well as additional homeland security spending, totaling at least  trillion.

most of the afghan population was already going hungry at the time of the september  attacks. in the aftermath of the attacks, tens of thousands of people attempted to flee afghanistan due to the possibility of military retaliation by the united states. pakistan, already home to many afghan refugees from previous conflicts, closed its border with afghanistan on september , . thousands of afghans also fled to the frontier with tajikistan, although were denied entry. the taliban leaders in afghanistan themselves pleaded against military action, saying we appeal to the united states not to put afghanistan into more misery because our people have suffered so much, referring to two decades of conflict and the humanitarian crisis attached to it.all united nations expatriates had left afghanistan after the attacks and no national or international aid workers were at their post. workers were instead preparing in bordering countries like pakistan, china and uzbekistan to prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe, amid a critically low food stock for the afghan population. the world food programme stopped importing wheat to afghanistan on september  due to security risks. the wall street journal suggested the creation of a buffer zone in an inevitable war, similarly as in the bosnian war.

approximately one month after the attacks, the united states led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the taliban regime from afghanistan for their harboring of alqaeda. though pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the united states against the taliban, they permitted the coalition access to their military bases, and arrested and handed over to the u.s. over  suspected alqaeda members.in a speech by the nizari ismaili imam at the nobel institute in , aga khan iv stated that the / attack on the united states was a direct consequence of the international community ignoring the human tragedy that was afghanistan at that time.in , the u.s. and nato under president obama initiated a drawdown of troops in afghanistan finalized in . during the presidencies of donald trump and joe biden in  and , the united states alongside its nato allies withdrew all troops from afghanistan completing the withdrawal of all regular u.s. troops on august , ,  days before the th anniversary of the september  attacks, the withdrawal marked the end of the  war in afghanistan. biden said that after nearly  years of war, it was clear that the u.s. military could not transform afghanistan into a modern democracy.the second emir of alqaeda, ayman alzawahiri, a close associate of bin laden, was killed in a u.s. drone strike at his home in kabul, afghanistan on july , .

the impact of / extends beyond geopolitics and into society and culture in general. immediate responses to / included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of american flags. the radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative, or thematic elements in film, music, literature, and humor. alreadyrunning television shows as well as programs developed after / have reflected post/ cultural concerns./ conspiracy theories have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from expert scientists, engineers, and historians. / has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals; for some it strengthened, to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lose it entirely, because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion.the culture of america succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel. antimuslim hate crimes rose nearly tenfold in  and have subsequently remained roughly five times higher than the pre/ rate.

as a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism. in germany, where several of the / terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that countrys liberal asylum policies, two major antiterrorism packages were enacted. the first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in germany. the second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. canada passed the canadian antiterrorism act, their first antiterrorism law. the united kingdom passed the antiterrorism, crime and security act  and the prevention of terrorism act . new zealand enacted the terrorism suppression act .in the united states, the department of homeland security was created by the homeland security act of  to coordinate domestic antiterrorism efforts. the usa patriot act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge; to monitor terror suspects telephone communications, email, and internet use; and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. the faa ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights.

further, the aviation and transportation security act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. the law created the transportation security administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. after suspected abuses of the usa patriot act were brought to light in june  with articles about the collection of american call records by the nsa and the prism program , representative jim sensenbrenner, who introduced the patriot act in , said that the nsa overstepped its bounds.criticism of the war on terror has focused on its morality, efficiency, and cost. according to a  study conducted under the auspices of the watson institute for international and public affairs, the several post/ wars participated in by the united states in its war on terror have caused the displacement, conservatively calculated, of  million people in afghanistan, pakistan, iraq, libya, syria, yemen, somalia, and the philippines. the study estimated these wars caused the deaths of , to , people and cost  trillion. the u.s. constitution and u.s. law prohibits the use of torture, yet such human rights violations occurred during the war on terror under the euphemism enhanced interrogation. in , the washington post and human rights watch  published revelations concerning cia flights and black sites, covert prisons operated by the cia. the term torture by proxy is used by some critics to describe situations in which the cia and other u.s. agencies have transferred suspected terrorists to countries known to employ torture.

as all  hijackers died in the attacks, they were never procecuted. osama bin laden, the mastermind of the attacks, was never formally indicted, but was after a year manhunt killed by u.s. special forces on may ,  in his compound in abbottabad, pakistan. to date, only peripheral persons have been convicted for charges in connection with the attacks. these are

zacarias moussaoui who was indicted in december  and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in may  by a u.s. federal jury

mounir el motassadeq who was first convicted in february  by a federal court of justice in germany and was deported to morocco in october  after serving his sentence

abu dahdah who was arrested in november , sentenced by a spanish high court and released from prison in may .the main trial of the attacks against mohammed and his coconspirators walid bin attash, ramzi bin alshibh, ammar albaluchi, and mustafa ahmad al hawsawi remains unresolved. charges were announced by brigadier general thomas w. hartmann on february ,  at a press conference hosted by the pentagon. in august , it was reported that the biden administration is considering a plea deal that would eliminate the death penalty. khalid sheikh mohammed was arrested on march , , in rawalpindi, pakistan, by pakistani security officials working with the cia. he was then held at multiple cia secret prisons and guantanamo bay, where he was interrogated and tortured with methods including waterboarding. during u.s. hearings at guantanamo bay in march , mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks, stating he was responsible for the / operation from a to z and that his statement was not made under duress. in , mustafa alhawsawi and abd alaziz ali were arrested and transferred to us custody. both would later be accused of providing money and travel assistance to the hijackers.

immediately after the attacks, the federal bureau of investigation started penttbom, the largest criminal inquiry in united states history. at its height, more than half of the fbis agents worked on the investigation and followed a halfmillion leads. the fbi concluded that there was clear and irrefutable evidence linking alqaeda and bin laden to the attacks.

the fbi was quickly able to identify the hijackers, including leader mohamed atta, when his luggage was discovered at bostons logan airport. atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the seat commuter flight he took to boston. due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays, the luggage failed to make it aboard american airlines flight  as planned. the luggage contained the hijackers names, assignments, and alqaeda connections. it had all these arablanguage sic papers that amounted to the rosetta stone of the investigation, said one fbi agent. within hours of the attacks, the fbi released the names and in many cases the personal details of the suspected pilots and hijackers. abu jandal, who served as bin ladens chief bodyguard for years, confirmed the identity of seven hijackers as alqaeda members during interrogations with the fbi on september . he had been jailed in a yemeni prison since . on september , , photos of all  hijackers were released, along with information about possible nationalities and aliases. fifteen of the men were from saudi arabia, two were from the united arab emirates, one was from egypt, and one was from lebanon.by midday, the u.s. national security agency and german intelligence agencies had intercepted communications pointing to osama bin laden. two of the hijackers were known to have traveled with a bin laden associate to malaysia in  and hijacker mohamed atta had previously gone to afghanistan. he and others were part of a terrorist cell in hamburg. one of the members of the hamburg cell in germany was discovered to have been in communication with khalid sheikh mohammed who was identified as a member of alqaeda.authorities in the united states and united kingdom also obtained electronic intercepts, including telephone conversations and electronic bank transfers, which indicated that mohammed atef, a bin laden deputy, was a key figure in the planning of the / attacks. intercepts were also obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before september  between bin laden and an associate in pakistan. in those conversations, the two referred to an incident that would take place in america on, or around, september  and they discussed potential repercussions. in another conversation with an associate in afghanistan, bin laden discussed the scale and effects of a forthcoming operation. these conversations did not specifically mention the world trade center, the pentagon, or other specifics.

in their annual violent crime index for the year of , the fbi recorded the deaths from the attacks as murder, in separate tables so as not to mix them with other reported crime for that year. in a disclaimer, the fbi stated that the number of deaths is so great that combining it with the traditional crime statistics will have an outlier effect that falsely skews all types of measurements in the programs analyses. new york city also did not include the deaths in their annual crime statistics for .

in , john l. helgerson, the inspector general of the central intelligence agency , conducted an internal review of the agencys pre/ performance and was harshly critical of senior cia officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism. according to philip giraldi in the american conservative, helgerson criticized their failure to stop two of the / hijackers, nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar, as they entered the united states and their failure to share information on the two men with the fbi.in may , senators from both major u.s. political parties  drafted legislation to make the review public. one of the backers, senator ron wyden said, the american people have a right to know what the central intelligence agency was doing in those critical months before /. the report was released in  by president barack obama.

in february , the senate select committee on intelligence and the house permanent select committee on intelligence formed a joint inquiry into the performance of the u.s. intelligence community. their page report released in december  detailed failings of the fbi and cia to use available information, including about terrorists the cia knew were in the united states, in order to disrupt the plots. the joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of saudi arabian government officials from nonclassified sources. nevertheless, the bush administration demanded  related pages remain classified. in december , the inquirys chair bob graham  revealed in an interview that there was evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the united states. september  victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the congressional inquiry and demanded an independent commission. september  victim families, members of congress and the saudi arabian government are still seeking release of the documents. in june , cia chief john brennan said that he believes  redacted pages of a congressional inquiry into / will soon be made public, and that they will prove that the government of saudi arabia had no involvement in the september  attacks.in september , the congress passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act that would allow relatives of victims of the september  attacks to sue saudi arabia for its governments alleged role in the attacks.

the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states, popularly known as the / commission, chaired by thomas kean, governor of new jersey from  to , was formed in late  to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks. on july , , the commission issued the / commission report, a page report based on its investigations and interviews. thehe report detailed the events leading up to the september  attacks, concluding that they were carried out by alqaeda. the commission also examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks.

according to the report, we believe the / attacks revealed four kinds of failures in imagination, policy, capabilities, and management. the commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks, and in  was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented.

the u.s. national institute of standards and technology  investigated the collapses of the twin towers and  wtc. the investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction. the investigation into the collapse of  wtc and  wtc was concluded in october  and that of  wtc was completed in august .nist found that the fireproofing on the twin towers steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. a  study of the north towers collapse published by researchers of purdue university determined that since the planes impact had stripped off much of the structures thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact.the director of the original investigation stated that the towers really did amazingly well. the terrorist aircraft didnt bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. it was proven that you could take out twothirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand. the fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. the sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward.

with the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. additionally, the report found the towers stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. nist concluded that uncontrolled fires in  wtc caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fireinduced progressive collapse that brought the building down.

in july , the obama administration released a document compiled by u.s. investigators dana lesemann and michael jacobson, known as file , which contains a list naming three dozen people, including the suspected saudi intelligence officers attached to saudi arabias embassy in washington, d.c., which connects saudi arabia to the hijackers.in september , congress passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. the practical effect of the legislation was to allow the continuation of a longstanding civil lawsuit brought by families of victims of the september  attacks against saudi arabia for its governments alleged role in the attacks. in march , a u.s. judge formally allowed a suit to move forward against the government of saudi arabia brought by / survivors and victims families.in , the families of some / victims obtained two videos and a notepad seized from saudi national omar albayoumi by the british courts. the first video showed him hosting a party in san diego for nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar, the first two hijackers to arrive in the u.s. the other video showed albayoumi greeting the cleric anwar alawlaki, who was blamed for radicalizing americans and later killed in a cia drone strike. the notepad depicted a handdrawn airplane and some mathematical equations that, according to a pilots court statement, might have been used to calculate the rate of descent to get to a target. according to a  fbi memo, from the late s up until the / attack, albayoumi was a paid cooptee of the saudi general intelligence presidency. as of april  he is believed to be living in saudi arabia, which has denied any involvement in /.

on the day of the attacks, new york city mayor rudy giuliani stated we will rebuild. were going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. the skyline will be made whole again.within hours of the attack, a substantial search and rescue operation was launched. after months of aroundtheclock operations, the world trade center site was cleared by the end of may . the damaged section of the pentagon was rebuilt and occupied within a year of the attacks. the temporary world trade center path station opened in late  and construction of the new  world trade center was completed in . work on rebuilding the main world trade center site was delayed until late , when leaseholder larry silverstein and the port authority of new york and new jersey agreed on financing. the construction of one world trade center began on april , , and reached its full height on may , . the spire was installed atop the building at that date, putting one wtcs height at , feet  and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the western hemisphere. one wtc finished construction and opened on november , .on the world trade center site, three more office towers were to be built one block east of where the original towers stood.  wtc, meanwhile, opened in november , making it the second tower on the site to open behind  world trade center, as well as the first building on the port authority property.  wtc opened on june , , becoming the fourth skyscraper at the site to be completed. in december , the nicholas greek orthodox church fully reopened for regular services followed by the opening of the ronald o. perelman performing arts center in september . with construction beginning in ,  world trade center remains as of november  unfinished. construction of a  world trade center is planned to begin in  and be finished by .christopher o. ward, port authority of new york and new jersey executive director from  to , is a survivor of the attacks and is credited with getting the construction of the / site back on track.

in the days immediately following the attacks, many memorials and vigils were held around the world, and photographs of the dead and missing were posted around ground zero. a witness described being unable to get away from faces of innocent victims who were killed. their pictures are everywhere, on phone booths, street lights, walls of subway stations. everything reminded me of a huge funeral, people quiet and sad, but also very nice. before, new york gave me a cold feeling; now people were reaching out to help each other.

one of the first memorials was the tribute in light, an installation of  searchlights at the footprints of the world trade center towers. in new york city, the world trade center site memorial competition was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site. the winning design, reflecting absence, was selected in august , and consists of a pair of reflecting pools in the footprints of the towers, surrounded by a list of the victims names in an underground memorial space. the memorial was completed on september , ; a museum also opened on site on may , .the sphere by the german sculptor fritz koenig is the worlds largest bronze sculpture of modern times, and stood between the twin towers on the austin j. tobin plaza of the world trade center in new york city from  until the terrorist attacks on september , . the sculpture, weighing more than  tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed twin towers after the attacks. since then, the work of art, known in the u.s. as the sphere, has been transformed into an important symbolic monument of / commemoration. after being dismantled and stored near a hangar at john f. kennedy international airport, the sculpture was the subject of the  documentary the sphere by filmmaker percy adlon. on august , , the work was reinstated, installed at the liberty park, close to the new world trade center aerial and the / memorial.in arlington county, the pentagon memorial was completed and opened to the public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in . it consists of a landscaped park with  benches facing the pentagon. when the pentagon was repaired in , a private chapel and indoor memorial were included, located at the spot where flight  crashed into the building.in shanksville, a concreteandglass visitor center was opened on september , , situated on a hill overlooking the crash site and the white marble wall of names. an observation platform at the visitor center and the white marble wall are both aligned beneath the path of flight . a temporary memorial is located  yards  from the crash site. new york city firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the world trade center and mounted on top of a platform shaped like the pentagon. it was installed outside the firehouse on august , . many other permanent memorials are elsewhere. scholarships and charities have been established by the victims families and by many other organizations and private figures.on every anniversary in new york city, the names of the victims who died there are read out against a background of somber music. the president of the united states attends a memorial service at the pentagon, and asks americans to observe patriot day with a moment of silence. smaller services are held in shanksville, pennsylvania, which are usually attended by the first lady. in september , president joe biden did not attend services in the affected areas, instead marking the day in anchorage, alaska, the first us president to do so since the attacks.

the united states of america , commonly known as the united states  or simply america, is a country primarily located in north america and consisting of  states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, and nine minor outlying islands. it includes  indian reservations. it is the worlds thirdlargest country by both land and total area. it shares land borders with canada to its north and with mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the bahamas, cuba, russia, and other nations. with a population of over  million, it is the most populous country in the americas and the thirdmost populous in the world. the national capital of the united states is washington, d.c., and its most populous city and principal financial center is new york city.

indigenous peoples have inhabited the americas for thousands of years. beginning in , british colonization led to the establishment of the thirteen colonies in what is now the eastern united states. they clashed with the british crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the american revolution and the ensuing revolutionary war. the united states declared independence on july , , becoming the first nationstate founded on enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. the country began expanding across north america, spanning the continent by . sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the confederate states of america, which fought the remaining states of the union during the american civil war . with the unions victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. however, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. by , the united states had established itself as a great power, becoming the worlds largest economy. after japans attack on pearl harbor in , the u.s. entered world war ii on the side of the allies. the aftermath of the war left the united states and the soviet union as the worlds two superpowers and led to the cold war, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. during the space race, the united states landed the first humans on the moon, notably with the apollo  mission in . following the soviet unions collapse and the end of the cold war, the united states has emerged as the worlds sole superpower since the s.

the united states government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government executive, legislative, and judicial. it has a bicameral national legislature composed of the house of representatives, a lower house based on population; and the senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the constitution. the u.s. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. it has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. as a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the u.s. has been extensively shaped by the worlds largest immigrant population.

highly developed, the u.s. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. the american economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global gdp and is the worlds largest by nominal gdp. the u.s. is the worlds largest importer and secondlargest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. it is a founding member of the united nations, the world bank, the international monetary fund, the organization of american states, nato and who, and is a permanent member of the united nations security council. it is the worlds foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.

the first documentary evidence of the phrase united states of america dates back to a letter from january , , written by stephen moylan, a continental army aide to general george washington, to joseph reed, washingtons aidedecamp. moylan expressed his desire to go with full and ample powers from the united states of america to spain to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort. the first known publication of the phrase united states of america was in an anonymous essay in the virginia gazette newspaper in williamsburg, on april , .by june , the name united states of america appeared in drafts of the articles of confederation and perpetual union, authored by john dickinson, a founding father from the province of pennsylvania, and in the declaration of independence, written primarily by thomas jefferson and adopted by the second continental congress in philadelphia, on july , .

the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia, crossing the bering land bridge and arriving in the presentday united states at least , years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival. the clovis culture, which appeared around ,bc, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement in the americas. this was likely the first of three major waves of migration into north america; later waves brought the ancestors of presentday athabaskans, aleuts, and eskimos.over time, indigenous cultures in north america grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the precolumbian mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies. the citystate of cahokia was the largest, most complex precolumbian archaeological site in presentday united states. in the four corners region in presentday southwestern united states, the culture of ancestral puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation. the algonquian, consisting of peoples who speak algonquian languages, were one of the most populous and widespread north american indigenous peoples. these people were historically prominent along the atlantic coast and in the saint lawrence river and great lakes regions. before european immigrants made contact, most of the algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the three sisters. by european contact in the th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands productivity and manage land. the ojibwe cultivated wild rice. the iroquois confederation haudenosaunee, located in the southern great lakes region, was established between the th and th centuries.estimating the native population of north america before the arrival of european immigrants is difficult. estimates range from over , to nearly  million living near the gulf of mexico, atlantic coast, and mississippi valley.the italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano, sent by france to the new world in , encountered native american inhabitants in the presentday new york bay region. the spanish empire set up their first settlements in florida and new mexico, including in saint augustine , which is often considered the nations oldest city, and santa fe . the french established their own settlements along the mississippi river and gulf of mexico, including in new orleans  and mobile .

british colonization of the east coast of north america began with the virginia colony in , where pilgrims settled in jamestown and later established plymouth colony in . many english settlers were dissenting christians who fled england seeking religious freedom.the continents first elected legislative assembly, the house of burgesses in virginia, was founded in . in , harvard college in cambridge, massachusetts bay colony was founded as the first institution of higher education. the mayflower compact and the fundamental orders of connecticut established precedents for representative selfgovernment and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies. the native population of america declined after european arrival, primarily as a result of infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. by the mids, the british defeated and seized the territory of dutch settlers in new netherland, in the midatlantic region.during the th century european colonization many european settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with native americans, particularly in king philips war. in addition to conflicts with european settlers, native american polities also warred with each other. but in many cases, the natives and settlers came to develop a mutual dependency. settlers traded for food and animal pelts, and native americans traded for guns, tools, and other european goods. native americans taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. european missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the native americans and urged them to adopt european agricultural practices and lifestyles. with the increased european colonization of north america, however, native americans were often displaced or killed during conflicts.european settlers also began trafficking african slaves into the colonial united states via the transatlantic slave trade. by the turn of the th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the southern colonies. colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts for or against it as well as laws designed to keep blacks subservient.in what was then considered british america, the thirteen colonies were administered as overseas dependencies by the british. all colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except jews and, in some areas, catholics. with very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing native american populations. the christian revivalist movement of the s and s, known as the great awakening, fueled colonial interest in both religion and religious liberty. excluding the native americans, the thirteen colonies had a population of over . million in , roughly a third the size of great britain. by the s, despite continuing new immigrant arrivals from britain and other european regions, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of americans had been born overseas. the colonies distance from britain had allowed for the development of selfgovernance in the colonies, but it encountered periodic efforts by british monarchs to reassert royal authority.

after the british victory in the french and indian war that was won largely through the support in men and materiel from the colonies, the british began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. in , to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the british government that extracted taxes from them, the first continental congress met in philadelphia and passed the continental association, which mandated a colonieswide boycott of british goods. the british attempted to disarm the americans, resulting in the battles of lexington and concord on april , , igniting the american revolutionary war. the then united colonies responded by again convening in philadelphia as the second continental congress where, in june , they appointed george washington as commanderinchief of the continental army, which was initially composed of various american patriot militias resisting the british army. in june , the second continental congress charged a committee with writing a declaration of independence, largely drafted by thomas jefferson.on july , , the second continental congress with alterations unanimously adopted and issued the declaration of independence, which famously stated we hold these truths to be selfevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. the adoption of the declaration of independence is celebrated annually on july  in the united states as independence day. in , the american victory at the battle of saratoga resulted in the capture of a british army, and led to france and their ally spain joining in the war against them. after the surrender of a second british army at the siege of yorktown in , britain signed a peace treaty. american sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the mississippi river, from what is presentday canada in the north to florida in the south. tensions with britain remained, leading to the war of , which was fought to a draw.

in , the articles of confederation and perpetual union established a decentralized government that operated until . considered one of the most important legislative acts of the confederation congress, northwest ordinance  established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the articles. the prohibition of slavery in the territory had the practical effect of establishing the ohio river as the geographic divide between slave states and free states from the appalachian mountains to the mississippi river, an extension of the masondixon line. it also helped set the stage for later federal political conflicts over slavery during the th century until the american civil war.as it became increasingly apparent that the confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the philadelphia convention of , where the united states constitution was authored and then ratified in state conventions in . the u.s. constitution is the oldest and longeststanding written and codified national constitution in force today. going into effect in , it reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches , on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. george washington, who led the continental army to victory in the revolutionary war and then willingly relinquished power, was elected the new nations first president under the new constitution. the bill of rights was adopted in , originally forbidding only federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, portions of the bill of rights are now applied to state and local governments by virtue of both state and federal court decisions.

 during the colonial period, slavery was legal in the american colonies, and challenges to its moral legitimacy were rare. however, during the american revolution, many began to question the practice. regional divisions over slavery grew in the ensuing decades, with prominent founding fathers in the northern united states advocating for the abolition of slavery. by the s, slavery had been abolished in all northern states. despite the federal government outlawing american participation in the atlantic slave trade in , the exponential increase in profits for southern elites resulting from the drastic reduction of cotton production costs after the invention of the cotton gin, spurred entrenchment and support of slavery in the southern united states.in the late th century, american settlers began to expand further westward, some of them with a sense of manifest destiny.the louisiana purchase  nearly doubled the acreage of the united states, effectively ending french colonial interest in north america and their opposition to american westward expansion. spain ceded florida and other gulf coast territory in , the second great awakening, especially in the period , converted millions to evangelical protestantism. in the north, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the south, methodists and baptists proselytized among slave populations. in , the missouri compromise admitted missouri as a slave state and maine as a free state, and instituted a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining louisiana purchase lands north of the  parallel. the outcome de facto sectionalized the country into two factions free states, which forbade slavery; and slave states, which protected the institution; it was controversial and widely seen as dividing the country along sectarian lines. as americans expanded further into land inhabited by native americans, the federal government often applied policies of indian removal or assimilation. the displacement prompted a long series of american indian wars west of the mississippi river and eventually conflict with mexico. most of these conflicts ended with the cession of native american territory and their confinement to indian reservations. the republic of texas was annexed in  during a period of expansionism, and the  oregon treaty with britain led to u.s. control of the presentday american northwest. victory in the mexicanamerican war resulted in the  mexican cession of california and much of the presentday american southwest, resulting in the u.s. spanning the continent from the atlantic to the pacific oceans.

sectional conflict regarding african slavery was the primary cause of the american civil war. with the  election of abraham lincoln, conventions in eleven slave states in the southern u.s. declared secession and formed the confederate states of america, while the remaining states, known as the union, maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate. on april , , the confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding fort sumter, a federal garrison in charleston harbor in south carolina. the ensuing american civil war fought between  and  became the deadliest military conflict in american history. the war resulted in the deaths of approximately , soldiers from both sides and upwards of , civilians, most of them in the south. in early july , the civil war began to turn in the unions favor following the union army under general ulysses s. grant successfully splitting the confederacy in two by capturing vicksburg in the west, denying it any further movement along or across the mississippi river and preventing supplies from texas and arkansas that might sustain the war effort from passing east, almost simultaneous with victory in the battle of gettysburg, where union army general george meade halted confederate army general robert e. lees invasion of the north. in april , following the union armys victory at the battle of appomattox court house, the confederacy surrendered and soon collapsed.reconstruction began in earnest following the defeat of the confederates. while president lincoln attempted to foster reconciliation between the union and former confederacy, his assassination on april ,  drove a wedge between north and south again. radical republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the south and to ensure the rights of african americans, and the socalled reconstruction amendments to the constitution guaranteed the abolishment of slavery, full citizenship to americans of african descent, and suffrage for adult black men. they persisted until the compromise of .to encourage additional westward settlement the homestead acts were several laws in the united states by which an applicant could acquire ownership of government land or the public domain, typically called a homestead. in all, more than  million acres  of public land, or nearly  percent of the total area of the united states, was given away free to . million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the mississippi river. the southern homestead act of  was enacted specifically to break a cycle of debt during reconstruction. prior to this act, blacks and impoverished whites alike were having trouble buying land or did not have the means to travel west. sharecropping and tenant farming had become ways of life. this act attempted to solve this by selling land at low prices so marginalized southerners could buy it. many, however, could still not participate because the low prices remained out of reach.

influential southern whites, calling themselves redeemers, took local control of the south after the end of reconstruction, leading to the nadir of american race relations. from  to , the redeemers established socalled jim crow laws, disenfranchising almost all blacks and some impoverished whites throughout the region. blacks faced racial segregation nationwide and codified discrimination, especially in the south, and lived under the threat of lynching and other vigilante violence.national infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the american old west. after the end of the american civil war in , new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with native americans. mainland expansion also included the purchase of alaska from russia in . in , proamerican elements in hawaii overthrew the hawaiian monarchy and formed the republic of hawaii, which the u.s. annexed in . puerto rico, guam, and the philippines were ceded by spain in the same year, by the treaty of paris  following the spanishamerican war. puerto ricans did not gain citizenship either through the foraker act  or the insular cases , but through the jonesshafroth act in , allowing for the conscription of , puerto ricans, which began two months later. american samoa was acquired by the united states in  after the end of the second samoan civil war. the u.s. virgin islands were purchased from denmark in .

from  through  an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the united states, . million in total. of those, . million  came from europe, including from great britain, ireland, scandinavia, germany, italy, russia and other parts of central and eastern europe. another . million came from canada. most came through the port of new york city, and from  specifically through the now iconic immigration station on ellis island there, but some ethnic groups tended to congregate in specific locations. new york and other large cities of the east coast became home to large jewish, irish, and italian populations, while many germans and central europeans moved to the midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. at the same time, about one million french canadians migrated from quebec to new england. the great migration, which began around , resulted in millions of african americans leaving the rural south for urban areas in the north.rapid economic development during the late th and early th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monoplies to prevent competition. tycoons like cornelius vanderbilt, john d. rockefeller, and andrew carnegie led the nations expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. banking became a major part of the economy, with j. p. morgan playing a notable role. the united states also emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry in the early th century. these changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. this period eventually ended with the advent of the progressive era, which was characterized by significant reforms, including health and safety regulation of consumer goods, the rise of labor unions, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition among businesses, and improvements in worker conditions.

the united states remained neutral after the outbreak of world war i in  until  when it joined the war as an associated power alongside the allies of world war i, helping to turn the tide against the central powers, and played a leading role in the paris peace conference. in , a constitutional amendment granted nationwide womens suffrage. during the s and s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the united states. the prosperity of the roaring twenties ended with the wall street crash of  and the onset of the great depression. after his election as president in , franklin d. roosevelt, between  and , introduced his new deal social and economic policies, which included public works projects, financial reforms, and regulations which represented a shift to a new current of modern liberalism in the united states. the dust bowl of the mids impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.at first neutral during world war ii, the u.s. began supplying war materiel to the allies of world war ii in march . on december , , the empire of japan launched a surprise attack on pearl harbor, causing the u.s. to militarily join the allies against the axis powers. the u.s. pursued a europe first defense policy, and the philippines was invaded and occupied by japan until its liberation by u.s. led forces in . the u.s. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them againast the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august ; the subsequent surrender of japan on september  ended world war ii. the united states was one of the four policemen who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the united kingdom, soviet union, and china. it played a leading role in the bretton woods and yalta conferences, and participated in a  international conference that produced the united nations charter, which became active after the wars end. the u.s. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.

after world war ii, the united states launched the marshall plan to aid in the reconstruction of europe. this period also marked the beginning of the cold war, where geopolitical tensions between the u.s. and the soviet union driven by ideological differences and competition for international influence led the two countries to dominate the affairs of europe, with the u.s.led capitalist western bloc opposing the sovietled communist eastern bloc. the u.s. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the soviet union, participated in conflicts like the korean and vietnam wars, and competed in the space race, culminating in the first crewed moon landing in . domestically, the u.s. experienced large economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following world war ii, and admitted alaska and hawaii as states.

the civil rights movement emerged, with martin luther king jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early s. president lyndon b. johnson initiated the great society, introducing sweeping legislation and policies to address poverty and racial inequalities, the voting rights act and the civil rights act most prominent among them. the counterculture movement in the u.s. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in vietnam.the presidency of richard nixon saw the american withdrawal from vietnam but also the watergate scandal, which led to his resignation and a decline in public trust of government that expanded for decades. after a surge in female labor participation around the s, by , the majority of women aged  and over were employed. the s and early s saw economic stagflation and president ronald reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the soviet union. the late s and early s saw the collapse of the warsaw pact and the dissolution of the soviet union, which marked the end of the cold war and solidified the u.s. as the worlds sole superpower.

in the first decades of the st century, the u.s. faced challenges from terrorism, with the september  attacks in  leading to the war on terror and military interventions in afghanistan and iraq. the u.s. housing bubble in  culminated in the  financial crisis and the great recession, the largest economic contraction since the great depression. amid the financial crisis, barack obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in .political polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion. the covid pandemic resulted in over  million confirmed cases and  million deaths, making it the most deadly pandemic in u.s. history. attempts to overturn the  u.s. presidential election culminated in the january ,  attack on the united states capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power to presidentelect joe biden.

world war i , also known as the first world war or the great war in historical contexts, was a major global conflict fought between two coalitions, the allied powers and the central powers. fighting took place throughout europe, the middle east, africa, the pacific, and parts of asia. one of the deadliest wars in history, it resulted in an estimated  million soldiers dead and  million wounded, plus another  million civilian deaths from various causes. millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a major factor in the  spanish flu pandemic.

the first decade of the th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the european great powers. this reached a breaking point on  june , when a bosnian serb named gavrilo princip assassinated archduke franz ferdinand, heir to the austrohungarian throne. austriahungary held serbia responsible, and declared war on  july. russia came to serbias defence, and by  august, germany, france, and britain were drawn into the war, with the ottoman empire joining in november of that same year.

germanys strategy in  was to first defeat france, then transfer forces to the russian front. however, this failed, and by the end of , the western front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the english channel to switzerland. the eastern front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. as the war expanded to more fronts, bulgaria, romania, greece, italy and others joined in from  onward. 

in early , the united states entered the war on the side of the allies, and later the same year, the bolsheviks seized power in the russian october revolution, making peace with the central powers in early . germany launched an offensive in the west in march , and despite initial success, it left the german army exhausted and demoralised. a successful allied counteroffensive later that year caused a collapse of the german frontline. by the end of , bulgaria, the ottoman empire and austriahungary agreed to armistices with the allies, leaving germany isolated. facing revolution at home and with his army on the verge of mutiny, kaiser wilhelm ii abdicated on  november. 

fighting ended with the armistice of  november , while the subsequent paris peace conference imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, notably the treaty of versailles. the dissolution of the russian, german, austrohungarian, and ottoman empires resulted in the creation of new independent states, including poland, finland, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia. the inability to manage postwar instability contributed to the outbreak of world war ii in september .

the term world war was first coined in september  by german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel. he claimed that there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared european war ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word, in the indianapolis star on  september .

the term first world war had been used by ltcol. charles à court repington, as a title for his memoirs ; he had noted his discussion on the matter with a major johnstone of harvard university in his diary entry of  september .prior to world war ii, the events of  were generally known as the great war or simply the world war. in august , the magazine the independent wrote this is the great war. it names itself. in october , the canadian magazine macleans similarly wrote, some wars name themselves. this is the great war. contemporary europeans also referred to it as the war to end war and it was also described as the war to end all wars due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.

for much of the th century, the major european powers maintained a tenuous balance of power among themselves, known as the concert of europe. after , this was challenged by a variety of factors, including britains withdrawal into socalled splendid isolation, the decline of the ottoman empire, new imperialism, and the rise of prussia under otto von bismarck. the  austroprussian war established prussian hegemony in germany, while victory in the  francoprussian war allowed bismarck to consolidate the german states into a german empire under prussian leadership. avenging the defeat of , or revanchism, and recovering the provinces of alsacelorraine became the principal objects of french policy for the next forty years.

in order to isolate france and avoid a war on two fronts, bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors  between austriahungary, russia and germany. after russian victory in the  russoturkish war, the league was dissolved due to austrian concerns over russian influence in the balkans, an area they considered of vital strategic interest. germany and austriahungary then formed the  dual alliance, which became the triple alliance when italy joined in . for bismarck, the purpose of these agreements was to isolate france by ensuring the three empires resolved any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in  by british and french attempts to negotiate directly with russia, he reformed the league in , which was renewed in  and . after the agreement lapsed in , he replaced it with the reinsurance treaty, a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austriahungary.bismarck viewed peace with russia as the foundation of german foreign policy but after becoming kaiser in , wilhelm ii forced him to retire and was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by his new chancellor, leo von caprivi. this provided france an opportunity to counteract the triple alliance by signing the francorussian alliance in , followed by the  entente cordiale with britain. the triple entente was completed by the  anglorussian convention. while these were not formal alliances, by settling longstanding colonial disputes in africa and asia, the notion of british entry into any future conflict involving france or russia became a possibility. british and russian support for france against germany during the agadir crisis in  reinforced their relationship and increased anglogerman estrangement, deepening the divisions that would erupt in .

german industrial strength and production significantly increased after , driven by the creation of a unified reich, french indemnity payments, and the annexation of alsacelorraine. backed by wilhelm ii, admiral alfred von tirpitz sought to use this growth in economic power to build a kaiserliche marine, or imperial german navy, which could compete with the british royal navy for world naval supremacy. his thinking was influenced by us naval strategist alfred thayer mahan, who argued possession of a bluewater navy was vital for global power projection; tirpitz had his books translated into german, while wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.however, it was also an emotional decision, driven by wilhelms simultaneous admiration for the royal navy and desire to outdo and surpass it. bismarck thought that the british would not interfere in europe, so long as its maritime supremacy remained secure, but his dismissal in  led to a change in policy and an anglogerman naval arms race began. despite the vast sums spent by tirpitz, the launch of hms dreadnought in  gave the british a technological advantage over their german rivals which they never lost. ultimately, the race diverted huge resources into creating a german navy large enough to antagonise britain, but not defeat it; in , chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading to the rüstungswende or armaments turning point, when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army.

this decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions, but german concern over russias quick recovery from its defeat in the russojapanese war and subsequent  russian revolution that same year. economic reforms backed by funding from the french led to a significant post expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure, particularly in its western border regions. since germany and austriahungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to russia, the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the royal navy. after germany expanded its standing army by , troops in , france extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures were taken by the balkan powers and italy, which led to increased expenditure by the ottomans and austriahungary. absolute figures are hard to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure, since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which also had logistical importance and military use. it is known, however, that from  to , military spending by the six major european powers increased by over  in real terms.

the years before  were marked by a series of crises in the balkans as other powers sought to benefit from ottoman decline. while panslavic and orthodox russia considered itself the protector of serbia and other slav states, they preferred the strategically vital bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak ottoman government, rather than an ambitious slav power like bulgaria. since russia had its own ambitions in northeastern anatolia and their clients had overlapping claims in the balkans, balancing these divided russian policymakers and added to regional instability.austrian statesmen viewed the balkans as essential for the continued existence of their empire, and saw serbian expansion as a direct threat. the  bosnian crisis began when austria annexed the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina, which it had occupied since . timed to coincide with the bulgarian declaration of independence from the ottoman empire, this unilateral action was denounced by the european powers, but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation. some historians see this as a significant escalation, ending any chance of austria cooperating with russia in the balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between serbia and italy, both of whom had their own expansionist ambitions in the region.tensions increased after the  italoturkish war demonstrated ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the balkan league, an alliance of serbia, bulgaria, montenegro, and greece. the league quickly overran most of the ottomans territory in the balkans during the  first balkan war, much to the surprise of outside observers. the serbian capture of ports on the adriatic resulted in partial austrian mobilisation starting on  november , including units along the russian border in galicia. in a meeting the next day, the russian government decided not to mobilise in response, unwilling to precipitate a war for which they were not as of yet prepared to handle.the great powers sought to reassert control through the  treaty of london, which created an independent albania, while enlarging the territories of bulgaria, serbia, montenegro and greece. however, disputes between the victors sparked the day second balkan war, when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on  june ; it was defeated, losing most of macedonia to serbia and greece, and southern dobruja to romania. the result was that even countries which benefited from the balkan wars, such as serbia and greece, felt cheated of their rightful gains, while for austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns, including germany. this complex mix of resentment, nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre balkans became known as the powder keg of europe.

on  june , archduke franz ferdinand of austria, heir presumptive to emperor franz joseph, visited sarajevo, capital of the recently annexed provinces of bosnia and herzegovina. six assassins from the movement known as young bosnia, or mlada bosna, took up positions along the route taken by the archdukes motorcade, with the intention of assassinating him. supplied with arms by extremists within the serbian black hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free bosnia from austrian rule, although there was little agreement on what would replace it.nedeljko čabrinović threw a grenade at the archdukes car and injured two of his aides, who were taken to hospital while the convoy carried on. the other assassins were also unsuccessful but an hour later, as ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers, his car took a wrong turn into a street where gavrilo princip was standing. he stepped forward and fired two pistol shots, fatally wounding ferdinand and his wife sophie, who both died shortly thereafter. although emperor franz joseph was shocked by the incident, political and personal differences meant the two men were not close; allegedly, his first reported comment was a higher power has reestablished the order which i, alas, could not preserve.according to historian zbyněk zeman, his reaction was reflected more broadly in vienna, where the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. on  and  june, the crowds listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened. nevertheless, the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and has been described by historian christopher clark as a / effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in vienna.

the austrohungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent antiserb riots in sarajevo, in which bosnian croats and bosniaks killed two bosnian serbs and damaged numerous serbowned buildings. violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo, in other cities in austrohungariancontrolled bosnia and herzegovina, croatia and slovenia. austrohungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately , prominent serbs,  to , of whom died in prison. a further  serbs were sentenced to death. a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs.

the assassination initiated the july crisis, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between austriahungary, germany, russia, france and britain. believing serbian intelligence helped organise franz ferdinands murder, austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this. however, the foreign ministry had no solid proof of serbian involvement and a dossier used to make its case was riddled with errors. on  july, austria delivered an ultimatum to serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities.

serbia ordered general mobilisation on  july, but accepted all the terms, except for those empowering austrian representatives to suppress subversive elements inside serbia, and take part in the investigation and trial of serbians linked to the assassination. claiming this amounted to rejection, austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day; on  july, they declared war on serbia and began shelling belgrade. having initiated war preparations on  july, russia now ordered general mobilisation in support of serbia on th.anxious to ensure backing from the spd political opposition by presenting russia as the aggressor, german chancellor bethmann hollweg delayed commencement of war preparations until  july. that afternoon the russian government were handed a note requiring them to cease all war measures against germany and austriahungary within  hours. a further german demand for neutrality was refused by the french who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war. the german general staff had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts; the schlieffen plan envisaged using  of the army to defeat france in the west, then switch to russia. since this required them to move quickly, mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon.

at a meeting on  july, the british cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to belgium under the  treaty of london did not require it to oppose a german invasion with military force. however, this was largely driven by prime minister asquiths desire to maintain unity; he and his senior cabinet ministers were already committed to support france, the royal navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention. on  july, britain sent notes to germany and france, asking them to respect belgian neutrality; france pledged to do so, germany did not reply.once the german ultimatum to russia expired on the morning of  august, the two countries were at war. later the same day, wilhelm was informed by his ambassador in london, prince lichnowsky, that britain would remain neutral if france was not attacked, and might not intervene at all given the ongoing home rule crisis in ireland. jubilant at this news, he ordered general moltke, the german chief of staff, to march the whole of the ... army to the east. this allegedly brought moltke to the verge of a nervous breakdown, who protested that it cannot be done. the deployment of millions cannot be improvised. lichnowsky soon realised he was mistaken, although wilhelm insisted on waiting for a telegram from his cousin george v; once received it confirmed there had been a misunderstanding, and he told moltke, now do what you want.aware of german plans to attack through belgium, french commanderinchief joseph joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and preempt such a move. to avoid a violation of belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a german invasion. on  august, germany occupied luxembourg and exchanged fire with french units; on  august, they declared war on france and demanded free passage across belgium, which was refused. early on the morning of  august, the germans invaded and albert i of belgium called for assistance under the treaty of london. britain sent germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from belgium; when this expired at midnight without a response, the two empires were at war.

the strategy of the central powers suffered from miscommunication. germany had promised to support austriahungarys invasion of serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in , but those had never been tested in exercises. austrohungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia.

beginning on  august, the austrian and serbs clashed at the battles of the cer and kolubara; over the next two weeks, austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses, dashing their hopes of a swift victory and marking the first major allied victories of the war. as a result, austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front, weakening its efforts against russia. serbias defeat of the  invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century. in spring , the campaign saw the first use of antiaircraft warfare after an austrian plane was shot down with groundtoair fire, as well as the first medical evacuation by the serbian army in autumn .

upon mobilisation in ,  of the german army was located on the western front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east; officially titled aufmarsch ii west, it is better known as the schlieffen plan after its creator, alfred von schlieffen, head of the german general staff from  to . rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier, the german right wing would sweep through the netherlands and belgium, then swing south, encircling paris and trapping the french army against the swiss border. schlieffen estimated this would take six weeks, after which the german army would transfer to the east and defeat the russians.the plan was substantially modified by his successor, helmuth von moltke the younger. under schlieffen,  of german forces in the west were assigned to the right wing, with the remainder holding along the frontier. by keeping his left wing deliberately weak, he hoped to lure the french into an offensive into the lost provinces of alsacelorraine, which was in fact the strategy envisaged by their plan xvii. however, moltke grew concerned the french might push too hard on his left flank and as the german army increased in size from  to , he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings from  to . he also considered dutch neutrality essential for german trade and cancelled the incursion into the netherlands, which meant any delays in belgium threatened the entire viability of the plan. historian richard holmes argues these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success and thus led to unrealistic goals and timings.

the initial german advance in the west was very successful and by the end of august the allied left, which included the british expeditionary force , was in full retreat. at the same time, the french offensive in alsacelorraine was a disastrous failure, with casualties exceeding ,, including , killed on  august during the battle of the frontiers. german planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in  and  but in , von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris.in , the russian stavka had agreed with the french to attack germany within fifteen days of mobilisation, ten days before the germans had anticipated, although it meant the two russian armies that entered east prussia on  august did so without many of their support elements.by the end of , german troops held strong defensive positions inside france, controlled the bulk of frances domestic coalfields and had inflicted , more casualties than it lost itself. however, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome, while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, twofront war. as was apparent to a number of german leaders, this amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the marne, crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter; we have lost the war. it will go on for a long time but lost it is already.

on  august , new zealand occupied german samoa, now the independent state of samoa. on  september, the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of new britain, then part of german new guinea. on  october, the german cruiser sms emden sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang. japan declared war on germany prior to seizing territories in the pacific which later became the south seas mandate, as well as german treaty ports on the chinese shandong peninsula at tsingtao. after vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser sms kaiserin elisabeth from tsingtao, japan declared war on austriahungary as well, and the ship was sunk at tsingtao in november . within a few months, allied forces had seized all german territories in the pacific, leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea.

some of the first clashes of the war involved british, french, and german colonial forces in africa. on  august, french and british troops invaded the german protectorate of togoland and kamerun. on  august, german forces in southwest africa attacked south africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. the german colonial forces in german east africa, led by colonel paul von lettowvorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during world war i and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe.

prior to the war, germany had attempted to use indian nationalism and panislamism to its advantage, a policy continued post by instigating uprisings in india, while the niedermayerhentig expedition urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers. however, contrary to british fears of a revolt in india, the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity. this was largely because leaders from the indian national congress and other groups believed support for the british war effort would hasten indian home rule, a promise allegedly made explicit in  by edwin montagu, then secretary of state for india.in , the british indian army was larger than the british army itself, and between  and  an estimated . million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe, africa, and the middle east, while the government of india and their princely allies supplied large quantities of food, money, and ammunition. in all, , soldiers served on the western front and nearly , in the middle east, with , killed and , wounded.the suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the british government to grant selfgovernment to india after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and resulted in the campaign for full independence led by mahatma gandhi.

prewar military tactics that emphasised open warfare and the individual rifleman proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in . technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult. both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without suffering heavy casualties. in time, however, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.after the first battle of the marne in september , allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the race to the sea. by the end of , the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the channel to the swiss border. since the germans were normally able to choose where to stand, they generally held the high ground, while their trenches tended to be better built; those constructed by the french and english were initially considered temporary, only needed until an offensive would smash the german defences. both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. on  april , at the second battle of ypres, the germans  used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front. several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battlewinning weapon, it became one of the mostfeared and bestremembered horrors of the war.

in february  the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun, lasting until december . the germans made initial gains, before french counterattacks returned matters to near their starting point. casualties were greater for the french, but the germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from , to , casualties suffered between the two combatants. verdun became a symbol of french determination and selfsacrifice.the battle of the somme was an anglofrench offensive of july to november . the opening day on  july  was the bloodiest single day in the history of the british army, which suffered , casualties, including , dead. as a whole, the somme offensive led to an estimated , british casualties, along with , french and , german. gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. the living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties  and the spanish flu.

at the start of the war, german cruisers were scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping. the british royal navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect allied shipping. for example, the light cruiser sms emden, which was part of the german east asia squadron stationed at qingdao, seized or sank  merchantmen, as well as a russian cruiser and a french destroyer. most of the squadron was returning to germany when it sank two british armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel in november , before being virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december. the sms dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries, but after the battle of más a tierra, these too had either been destroyed or interned.soon after the outbreak of hostilities, britain began a naval blockade of germany. the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries. britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. since there was limited response to this tactic of the british, germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.the battle of jutland  in may/june  developed into the largest naval battle of the war. it was the only fullscale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. the kaiserliche marines high seas fleet, commanded by vice admiral reinhard scheer, fought the royal navys grand fleet, led by admiral sir john jellicoe. the engagement was a stand off, as the germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger british fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the british fleet than they received. strategically, however, the british asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the german surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.

german uboats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain. the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. the united states launched a protest, and germany changed its rules of engagement. after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in , germany promised not to target passenger liners, while britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the cruiser rules, which demanded warning and movement of crews to a place of safety . finally, in early , germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising the americans would eventually enter the war. germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.the uboat threat lessened in , when merchant ships began travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers. this tactic made it difficult for uboats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. the solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys. the uboats had sunk more than , allied ships, at a cost of  submarines.world war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july , as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.

faced with russia in the east, austriahungary could spare only onethird of its army to attack serbia. after suffering heavy losses, the austrians briefly occupied the serbian capital, belgrade. a serbian counterattack in the battle of kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of . for the first ten months of , austriahungary used most of its military reserves to fight italy. german and austrohungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading bulgaria to join the attack on serbia. the austrohungarian provinces of slovenia, croatia and bosnia provided troops for austriahungary in the fight with serbia, russia and italy. montenegro allied itself with serbia.bulgaria declared war on serbia on  october  and joined in the attack by the austrohungarian army under mackensens army of , that was already underway. serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the central powers, now including bulgaria, sent in , troops total. the serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern albania. the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo. montenegro covered the serbian retreat towards the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac in  january , but ultimately the austrians also conquered montenegro. the surviving serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to greece. after conquest, serbia was divided between austrohungary and bulgaria.in late , a francobritish force landed at salonica in greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the central powers. however, the progerman king constantine i dismissed the proallied government of eleftherios venizelos before the allied expeditionary force arrived.the macedonian front was initially mostly static. french and serbian forces retook limited areas of macedonia by recapturing bitola on  november  following the costly monastir offensive, which brought stabilisation of the front.

serbian and french troops finally made a breakthrough in september  in the vardar offensive, after most of the german and austrohungarian troops had been withdrawn. the bulgarians were defeated at the battle of dobro pole, and by  september british and french troops had crossed the border into bulgaria proper as the bulgarian army collapsed. bulgaria capitulated four days later, on  september . the german high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.the disappearance of the macedonian front meant that the road to budapest and vienna was now opened to allied forces. hindenburg and ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the central powers and, a day after the bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.

the ottomans threatened russias caucasian territories and britains communications with india via the suez canal. as the conflict progressed, the ottoman empire took advantage of the european powers preoccupation with the war and conducted largescale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous armenian, greek, and assyrian christian populations, known as the armenian genocide, greek genocide, and sayfo respectively.the british and french opened overseas fronts with the gallipoli  and mesopotamian campaigns . in gallipoli, the ottoman empire successfully repelled the british, french, and australian and new zealand army corps . in mesopotamia, by contrast, after the defeat of the british defenders in the siege of kut by the ottomans , british imperial forces reorganised and captured baghdad in march . the british were aided in mesopotamia by local arab and assyrian fighters, while the ottomans employed local kurdish and turcoman tribes.further to the west, the suez canal was defended from ottoman attacks in  and ; in august, a german and ottoman force was defeated at the battle of romani by the anzac mounted division and the nd  infantry division. following this victory, an egyptian expeditionary force advanced across the sinai peninsula, pushing ottoman forces back in the battle of magdhaba in december and the battle of rafa on the border between the egyptian sinai and ottoman palestine in january .russian armies generally had success in the caucasus campaign. enver pasha, supreme commander of the ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of reconquering central asia and areas that had been lost to russia previously. he was, however, a poor commander. he launched an offensive against the russians in the caucasus in december  with , troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous russian positions in winter. he lost  of his force at the battle of sarikamish.

the ottoman empire, with german support, invaded persia  in december  in an effort to cut off british and russian access to petroleum reservoirs around baku near the caspian sea. persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of british and russian influence. the ottomans and germans were aided by kurdish and azeri forces, together with a large number of major iranian tribes, such as the qashqai, tangistanis, lurs, and khamseh, while the russians and british had the support of armenian and assyrian forces. the persian campaign was to last until  and end in failure for the ottomans and their allies. however, the russian withdrawal from the war in  led to armenian and assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards british lines in northern mesopotamia.

general yudenich, the russian commander from  to , drove the turks out of most of the southern caucasus with a string of victories.the arab revolt, instigated by the arab bureau of the british foreign office, started june  with the battle of mecca, led by sharif hussein of mecca, and ended with the ottoman surrender of damascus. fakhri pasha, the ottoman commander of medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the siege of medina before surrendering in january .the senussi tribe, along the border of italian libya and british egypt, incited and armed by the turks, waged a smallscale guerrilla war against allied troops. the british were forced to dispatch , troops to oppose them in the senussi campaign. their rebellion was finally crushed in mid.total allied casualties on the ottoman fronts amounted , men. total ottoman casualties were ,, with , dead and , wounded.

although italy joined the triple alliance in , a treaty with its traditional austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in . this arose from nationalist designs on austrohungarian territory in trentino, the austrian littoral, rijeka and dalmatia, which were considered vital to secure the borders established in . in , rome secretly agreed with france to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by germany, effectively nullifying its role in the triple alliance.

when the war began in , italy argued the triple alliance was defensive in nature and it was not obliged to support an austrian attack on serbia. opposition to joining the central powers increased when turkey became a member in september, since in  italy had occupied ottoman possessions in libya and the dodecanese islands. to secure italian neutrality, the central powers offered them the french protectorate of tunisia, while in return for an immediate entry into the war, the allies agreed to their demands for austrian territory and sovereignty over the dodecanese. although they remained secret, these provisions were incorporated into the april  treaty of london; italy joined the triple entente and on  may declared war on austriahungary, followed by germany fifteen months later.

the pre italian army was the weakest in europe, short of officers, trained men, adequate transport and modern weapons; by april , some of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for the major offensive required by the treaty of london. the advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain; much of the fighting took place at altitudes of over  metres in the alps and dolomites, where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge. these issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics. between  and , the italian commander, luigi cadorna, undertook a series of frontal assaults along the isonzo which made little progress and cost many lives; by the end of the war, total italian combat deaths totalled around ,.in the spring of , the austrohungarians counterattacked in asiago in the strafexpedition, but made little progress and were pushed by the italians back to the tyrol. although an italian corps occupied southern albania in may , their main focus was the isonzo front which after the capture of gorizia in august  remained static until october . after a combined austrogerman force won a major victory at caporetto, cadorna was replaced by armando diaz who retreated more than  kilometres  before holding positions along the piave river. a second austrian offensive was repulsed in june  and by october it was clear the central powers had lost the war. on  october, diaz launched the battle of vittorio veneto and initially met stubborn resistance,  but with austriahungary collapsing, hungarian divisions in italy now demanded they be sent home. when this was granted, many others followed and the imperial army disintegrated, the italians taking over , prisoners. on  november, the armistice of villa giusti ended hostilities between austriahungary and italy which occupied trieste and areas along the adriatic sea awarded to it in .

despite secretly agreeing to support the triple alliance in , romania increasingly found itself at odds with the central powers over their support for bulgaria in the  to  balkan wars and the status of ethnic romanian communities in hungariancontrolled transylvania, which comprised an estimated . million of the . million population. with the ruling elite split into progerman and proentente factions, romania remained neutral in , arguing like italy that because austriahungary had declared war on serbia, it was under no obligation to join them. they maintained this position for the next two years, while allowing germany and austria to transport military supplies and advisors across romanian territory.in september , russia had acknowledged romanian rights to austrohungarian territories including transylvania and banat, whose acquisition had widespread popular support,  and russian success against austria led romania to join the entente in the august  treaty of bucharest. under the strategic plan known as hypothesis z, the romanian army planned an offensive into transylvania, while defending southern dobruja and giurgiu against a possible bulgarian counterattack. on  august , they attacked transylvania and occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by the recently formed german th army, led by former chief of staff falkenhayn. a combined germanbulgarianturkish offensive captured dobruja and giurgiu, although the bulk of the romanian army managed to escape encirclement and retreated to bucharest, which surrendered to the central powers on  december .

on  may  romania signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers, which recognised romanian sovereignty over bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the carpathian mountains to austriahungary and granting oil concessions to germany. although approved by parliament, ferdinand i refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an allied victory; romania reentered the war on  november  on the side of the allies and the treaty of bucharest was formally annulled by the armistice of  november . between  and , an estimated , to , ethnic romanians served with the austrohungarian army, of whom up to , were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary romanian borders are estimated at ,.

as previously agreed with france, russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into austrian galicia and east prussia as soon as possible. although their attack on galicia was largely successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing germany to divert troops from the western front, the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions. these weaknesses contributed to russian defeats at tannenberg and the masurian lakes in august and september , forcing them to withdraw from east prussia with heavy losses. by spring , they had also retreated from galicia, and the may  gorlicetarnów offensive then allowed the central powers to invade russianoccupied poland.despite the successful june  brusilov offensive against the austrians in eastern galicia, shortages of supplies, heavy losses and command failures prevented the russians from fully exploiting their victory. however, it was one of the most significant and impactful offensives of the war, diverting german resources from verdun, relieving austrohungarian pressure on the italians, and convincing romania to enter the war on the side of the allies on  august. it also fatally weakened both the austrian and russian armies, whose offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and increased the disillusionment with the war that ultimately led to the russian revolutions.meanwhile, unrest grew in russia as the tsar remained at the front, with the home front controlled by empress alexandra. her increasingly incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread protests and the murder of her favourite, grigori rasputin, at the end of .

on  december , after ten brutal months of the battle of verdun and a successful offensive against romania, germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the allies. however, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a duplicitous war ruse.soon after, us president woodrow wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands and start negotiations. lloyd georges war cabinet considered the german offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the allies. after initial outrage and much deliberation, they took wilsons note as a separate effort, signalling that the united states was on the verge of entering the war against germany following the submarine outrages. while the allies debated a response to wilsons offer, the germans chose to rebuff it in favour of a direct exchange of views. learning of the german response, the allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of  january. they sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for france, russia and romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. this included the liberation of italians, slavs, romanians, czechoslovaks, and the creation of a free and united poland. on the question of security, the allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement. the negotiations failed and the entente powers rejected the german offer on the grounds that germany had not put forward any specific proposals.

by the end of , russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices. in march , tsar nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress a wave of strikes in petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds. revolutionaries set up the petrograd soviet and fearing a leftwing takeover, the state duma forced nicholas to abdicate and established the russian provisional government, which confirmed russias willingness to continue the war. however, the petrograd soviet refused to disband, creating competing power centres and caused confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised and unwilling to fight on.following the tsars abdication, vladimir leninwith the help of the german governmentwas ushered by train from switzerland into russia on  april . discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the bolshevik party, led by lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. the revolution of november was followed in december by an armistice and negotiations with germany. at first, the bolsheviks refused the german terms, but when german troops began marching across ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the treaty of brestlitovsk on  march . the treaty ceded vast territories, including finland, estonia, latvia, lithuania, parts of poland and ukraine to the central powers.with the russian empire out of the war, romania found itself alone on the eastern front and signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers in may , ending the state of war between romania and the central powers. under the terms of the treaty, romania had to give territory to austriahungary and bulgaria, and lease its oil reserves to germany. however, the terms also included the central powers recognition of the union of bessarabia with romania.

the united states was a major supplier of war materiel to the allies but remained neutral in , in large part due to domestic opposition. the most significant factor in creating the support wilson needed was the german submarine offensive, which not only cost american lives, but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea.on  april , congress declared war on germany as an associated power of the allies. the united states navy sent a battleship group to scapa flow to join the grand fleet and provided convoy escorts. in april , the united states army had fewer than , men, including national guard units, compared to british and french armies of . and . million respectively. the selective service act of  drafted . million men, although training and equipping such numbers was a huge logistical challenge. by june , over , members of the american expeditionary forces , had been transported to france, a figure which reached  million by the end of november.despite his conviction germany must be defeated, wilson went to war to ensure the us played a leading role in shaping the peace, which meant preserving the aef as a separate military force, rather than being absorbed into british or french units as his allies wanted. he was strongly supported by aef commander general john j. pershing, a proponent of pre open warfare who considered the french and british emphasis on artillery as misguided and incompatible with american offensive spirit. much to the frustration of his allies, who had suffered heavy losses in , he insisted on retaining control of american troops and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units. as a result, the first significant us involvement was the meuseargonne offensive in late september .

in december , robert nivelle replaced pétain as commander of french armies on the western front and began planning a spring attack in champagne, part of a joint francobritish operation. nivelle claimed the capture of his main objective, the chemin des dames, would achieve a massive breakthrough and cost no more than , casualties. poor security meant german intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on  april the french made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the hindenburg line. nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by  april the french had suffered nearly , casualties, including , dead, most incurred in the first two days.

concurrent british attacks at arras were more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. operating as a separate unit for the first time, the canadian corps capture of vimy ridge during the battle is viewed by many canadians as a defining moment in creating a sense of national identity. although nivelle continued the offensive, on  may the st division, which had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting at verdun, refused orders to go into battle, initiating the french army mutinies; within days, acts of collective indiscipline had spread to  divisions, while over , deserted. unrest was almost entirely confined to the infantry, whose demands were largely nonpolitical, including better economic support for families at home, and regular periods of leave, which nivelle had ended.

in march and april , at the first and second battles of gaza, german and ottoman forces stopped the advance of the egyptian expeditionary force, which had begun in august  at the battle of romani. at the end of october, the sinai and palestine campaign resumed, when general edmund allenbys xxth corps, xxi corps and desert mounted corps won the battle of beersheba. two ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the battle of mughar ridge and, early in december, jerusalem was captured following another ottoman defeat at the battle of jerusalem. about this time, friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the eighth armys commander, replaced by djevad pasha, and a few months later the commander of the ottoman army in palestine, erich von falkenhayn, was replaced by otto liman von sanders.in early , the front line was extended and the jordan valley was occupied, following the first transjordan and the second transjordan attacks by british empire forces in march and april .

in december , the central powers signed an armistice with russia, thus freeing large numbers of german troops for use in the west. with german reinforcements and new american troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the western front. the central powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. ludendorff drew up plans  for the  offensive on the western front. the operation commenced on  march  with an attack on british forces near saintquentin. german forces achieved an unprecedented advance of  kilometres . the initial offensive a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the germans were unable to consolidate their gains. the problems of resupply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shelltorn and often impassable to traffic.following this, germany launched operation georgette against the northern english channel ports. the allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by germany. the german army to the south then conducted operations blücher and yorck, pushing broadly towards paris. germany launched operation marne  on  july, in an attempt to encircle reims. the resulting counterattack, which started the hundred days offensive on  august, caused a marked collapse in german morale.

in september, the allies advanced to the hindenburg line in the north and centre. german forces launch numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the line continued to fall, with the bef alone taking , prisoners in the last week of september. on  september, supreme army command informed the leaders in berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.the final assault on the hindenburg line began with the meuseargonne offensive, launched by american and french troops on  september. the following week, cooperating american and french units broke through in champagne at the battle of blanc mont ridge, forcing the germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the belgian frontier. on  october the line was pierced again by british and dominion troops at the battle of cambrai.

allied forces started the vardar offensive on  september at two key points dobro pole and near dojran lake. in the battle of dobro pole, the serbian and french armies had success after a three day long battle with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front, something which was rarely seen in world war i. after the front was broken, allied forces started to liberate serbia and reached skopje at  september, after which bulgaria signed an armistice with the allies on  september.

the collapse of the central powers came swiftly. bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the armistice of salonica on  september . german emperor wilhelm ii in a telegram to bulgarian tsar ferdinand i described the situation thus disgraceful , serbs decided the war. on the same day, the german supreme army command informed kaiser wilhelm ii and the imperial chancellor count georg von hertling, that the military situation facing germany was hopeless.on  october, the italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the battle of caporetto. this culminated in the battle of vittorio veneto, which marked the end of the austrohungarian army as an effective fighting force. the offensive also triggered the disintegration of the austrohungarian empire. during the last week of october, declarations of independence were made in budapest, prague, and zagreb. on  october, the imperial authorities asked italy for an armistice, but the italians continued advancing, reaching trento, udine, and trieste. on  november, austriahungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice . the terms, arranged by telegraph with the allied authorities in paris, were communicated to the austrian commander and accepted. the armistice with austria was signed in the villa giusti, near padua, on  november. austria and hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the habsburg monarchy. in the following days, the italian army occupied innsbruck and all tyrol with over , soldiers.on  october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros.

with the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, germany moved towards surrender. prince maximilian of baden took charge of a new government on  october as chancellor of germany to negotiate with the allies. negotiations with president wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the british and french. wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the german military.in northern germany, the german revolution of  began at the end of october . units of the german navy refused to set sail for a last, largescale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. the sailors revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of wilhelmshaven and kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on  november , shortly thereafter to the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii, and to german surrender.

in the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared the german, austrohungarian, ottoman, and russian. numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war the romanovs, the hohenzollerns, the habsburgs, and the ottomans. belgium and serbia were badly damaged, as was france, with . million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. germany and russia were similarly affected.

a formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the treaty of versailles with germany on  june . the united states senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the knoxporter resolution was signed on  july  by president warren g. harding. for the united kingdom and the british empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the termination of the present war  act  with respect to

germany on  january .

austria on  july .

bulgaria on  august .

hungary on  july .

turkey on  august .some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the versailles treaty was signed in , which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the wars end concentrate on the armistice of  november .

after the war, there grew a certain amount of academic focus on the causes of war and on the elements that could make peace flourish. in part, these led to the institutionalization of peace and conflict studies, security studies and international relations  in general. the paris peace conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the central powers officially ending the war. the  treaty of versailles dealt with germany and, building on wilsons th point, brought into being the league of nations on  june .the central powers had to acknowledge responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by their aggression. in the treaty of versailles, this statement was article . this article became known as the war guilt clause as the majority of germans felt humiliated and resentful. overall the germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the diktat of versailles. german historian hagen schulze said the treaty placed germany under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated. belgian historian laurence van ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the versailles treaty in german politics in the s and s

active denial of war guilt in germany and german resentment at both reparations and continued allied occupation of the rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. the legend of the stab in the back and the wish to revise the versailles diktat, and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the german nation persisted at the heart of german politics. even a man of peace such as gustav stresemann publicly rejected german guilt. as for the nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the german nation into a spirit of revenge. like a fascist italy, nazi germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.

meanwhile, new nations liberated from german rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours.austriahungary was partitioned into several successor states, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. apart from austria and hungary, czechoslovakia, italy, poland, romania and yugoslavia received territories from the dual monarchy . the details were contained in the saintgermainenlaye and the treaty of trianon. as a result, hungary lost  of its total population, decreasing from . million to . million and losing   of its ethnic hungarians. according to the  census, speakers of the hungarian language included approximately  of the entire population of the kingdom of hungary. within the country, numerous ethnic minorities were present . romanians, . slovaks, . germans, . ruthenians, . serbs and  others. between  and , , hungarians fled former hungarian territories attached to romania, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia.the russian empire, which had withdrawn from the war in  after the october revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of estonia, finland, latvia, lithuania, and poland were carved from it. romania took control of bessarabia in april .

after  years, poland reemerged as an independent country. the kingdom of serbia and its dynasty, as a minor entente nation and the country with the most casualties per capita, became the backbone of a new multinational state, the kingdom of serbs, croats and slovenes, later renamed yugoslavia. czechoslovakia, combining the kingdom of bohemia with parts of the kingdom of hungary, became a new nation. romania would unite all romanianspeaking people under a single state leading to greater romania.in the british empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. in australia and new zealand, the battle of gallipoli became known as those nations baptism of fire. it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that australian troops fought as australians, not just subjects of the british crown, and independent national identities for these nations took hold. anzac day, commemorating the australian and new zealand army corps , celebrates this defining moment.in the aftermath of world war i, greece fought against turkish nationalists led by mustafa kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the treaty of lausanne. according to various sources, several hundred thousand greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the greek genocide.

of the  million european military personnel who were mobilised from  to ,  million were killed,  million were permanently disabled, and  million were seriously injured. germany lost . of its active male population, austriahungary lost ., and france lost .. france mobilised . million men, of which . million died and . million were injured. among the soldiers mutilated and surviving in the trenches, approximately , sustained horrific facial injuries, causing them to undergo social stigma and marginalisation; they were called the gueules cassées. in germany, civilian deaths were , higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. these excess deaths are estimated as , in , plus another , in the first half of  when the blockade was still in effect. by the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately , people in lebanon. between  and  million people died in the russian famine of . by , there were between . million and  million homeless children in russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from world war i, the russian civil war, and the subsequent famine of . numerous antisoviet russians fled the country after the revolution; by the s, the northern chinese city of harbin had , russians.

diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. in  alone, louseborne epidemic typhus killed , in serbia. from  to , russia had about  million infections and  million deaths from epidemic typhus. in ,  million russians contracted malaria, a sharp increase from the prewar years. starting in early , a major influenza epidemic known as spanish flu spread around the world, accelerated by the movement of large number of soldiers, often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor sanitation. overall, the spanish flu killed at least  million to  million people, including an estimated . million europeans and as many as , americans. moreover, between  and , an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.

the german army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the second battle of ypres , after german scientists working under the direction of fritz haber at the kaiser wilhelm institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine. the use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the german high command in an effort to force allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons. in time, chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately . million casualties, but relatively few fatalities about , in total. for example, there were an estimated , british chemical weapons casualties during the war , and up to onethird of american casualties were caused by them. the russian army reportedly suffered roughly , chemical weapon casualties in world war i. the use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the  hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the  hague convention on land warfare, which prohibited their use.

the ethnic cleansing of the ottoman empires armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the ottoman empire is considered genocide. the ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination. in early , a number of armenians volunteered to join the russian forces and the ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the tehcir law , which authorised the deportation of armenians from the empires eastern provinces to syria between  and . the armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by ottoman brigands. while an exact number of deaths is unknown, the international association of genocide scholars estimates . million. the government of turkey has consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of interethnic fighting, famine, or disease during world war i; these claims are rejected by most historians.other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period, including assyrians and greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. at least , assyrian christians, about half of the population, and ,, anatolian and pontic greeks were killed between  and .

allied personnel was around ,, while central personnel was near ,,. the british soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service. surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. grouping together, they formed veterans associations or legions. a small number of personal accounts of american veterans have been collected by the library of congress veterans history project.

about eight million soldiers surrendered and were held in pow camps during the war. all nations pledged to follow the hague conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for pows was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front. of russian losses  were to prisoner status, for austriahungary , for italy , for france , for germany ; for britain . prisoners from the allied armies totalled about . million . from the central powers about . million soldiers became prisoners; most of them surrendered to russians.the most dangerous moment was the act of surrender when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory , thanks in part to the efforts of the international red cross and inspections by neutral nations. however, conditions were terrible in russia. starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike. about  of the prisoners in russia died, and in central powers imprisonment  of russians. in germany, food was scarce, but only  died.

the ottoman empire often treated pows poorly. some , british empire soldiers, most of them indians, became prisoners after the siege of kut in mesopotamia in april ; , died in captivity. although many were in a poor condition when captured, ottoman officers forced them to march , kilometres  to anatolia. a survivor said we were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die. the survivors were then forced to build a railway through the taurus mountains.

while the allied prisoners of the central powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to central power prisoners of the allies and russia, many of whom served as forced labour, e.g., in france until . they were released only after many approaches by the red cross to the supreme war council. german prisoners were still being held in russia as late as .

military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern embedded positions within the opposing land and naval forces.

conscription was common in most european countries. however, it was controversial in englishspeaking countries. it was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groupsespecially the irish catholics in ireland and australia, and the french catholics in canada.in the united states, conscription began in  and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower after only , volunteers enlisted out of the initial  million target in the first six weeks of the war.

macro and microeconomic consequences devolved from the war. families were altered by the departure of many men. with the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. at the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. this aided the struggle for voting rights for women.in all nations, the governments share of gdp increased, surpassing  in both germany and france and nearly reaching that level in britain. to pay for purchases in the united states, britain cashed in its extensive investments in american railroads and then began borrowing heavily from wall street. president wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late  but allowed a great increase in us government lending to the allies. after , the us demanded repayment of these loans. the repayments were, in part, funded by german reparations that, in turn, were supported by american loans to germany. this circular system collapsed in  and some loans were never repaid. britain still owed the united states . billion of world war i debt in ; the last installment was finally paid in .britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. geologists such as albert kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the african colonies. kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in the gold coast.article  of the treaty of versailles  stated germany accepted responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany and her allies. it was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with austria and hungary. however, neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt. in , the total reparation sum was placed at  billion gold marks. however, allied experts knew that germany could not pay this sum. the total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being deliberately designed to be chimerical and its primary function was to mislead public opinion ... into believing the total sum was being maintained. thus,  billion gold marks  represented the actual allied assessment of german capacity to pay and therefore  represented the total german reparations figure that had to be paid.this figure could be paid in cash or inkind . in addition, some of the territory lostvia the treaty of versailleswas credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the library of louvain. by , the great depression arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world. in  the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point germany had paid only the equivalent of . billion gold marks in reparations. with the rise of adolf hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the s and early s were cancelled. david andelman notes refusing to pay doesnt make an agreement null and void. the bonds, the agreement, still exist. thus, following the second world war, at the london conference in , germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. on  october , germany made the final payment on these bonds.the australian prime minister, billy hughes, wrote to the british prime minister, david lloyd george, you have assured us that you cannot get better terms. i much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the british empire and her allies. australia received ,, war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to australia had been ,,, and, by the mids, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were ,,. of about , australians who served, about , were killed and another , were wounded.the war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from womens jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch, which requires a free hand to operate. trench watches were designed for use by the military as pocket watches were not as effective for combat. military funding of advancements in radio contributed to the postwar popularity of the medium.

in the balkans, yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, ante trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of yugoslavs from austriahungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent yugoslavia. the yugoslav committee, led by trumbić, was formed in paris on  april  but shortly moved its office to london. in april , the rome congress of oppressed nationalities met, including czechoslovak, italian, polish, transylvanian, and yugoslav representatives who urged the allies to support national selfdetermination for the peoples residing within austriahungary.in the middle east, arab nationalism soared in ottoman territories in response to the rise of turkish nationalism during the war, with arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a panarab state. in , the arab revolt began in ottomancontrolled territories of the middle east in an effort to achieve independence.in east africa, iyasu v of ethiopia was supporting the dervish state who were at war with the british in the somaliland campaign. von syburg, the german envoy in addis ababa, said, now the time has come for ethiopia to regain the coast of the red sea driving the italians home, to restore the empire to its ancient size. the ethiopian empire was on the verge of entering world war i on the side of the central powers before iyasus overthrow at the battle of segale due to allied pressure on the ethiopian aristocracy. iyasu was accused of converting to islam. according to ethiopian historian bahru zewde, the evidence used to prove iyasus conversion was a doctored photo of iyasu wearing a turban provided by the allies. some historians claim the british spy t. e. lawrence forged the iyasu photo.

a number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in august . but european socialists split on national lines, with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war. once the war began, austrian, british, french, german, and russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries intervention in the war.italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. one of the most prominent and popular italian nationalist supporters of the war was gabriele dannunzio, who promoted italian irredentism and helped sway the italian public to support intervention in the war. the italian liberal party, under the leadership of paolo boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the allies and used the dante alighieri society to promote italian nationalism. italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including benito mussolini and leonida bissolati. however, the italian socialist party decided to oppose the war after antimilitarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called red week. the italian socialist party purged itself of prowar nationalist members, including mussolini. mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on italianpopulated regions of austriahungary, formed the prointerventionist il popolo ditalia and the fasci rivoluzionario dazione internazionalista  in october  that later developed into the fasci italiani di combattimento in , the origin of fascism. mussolinis nationalism enabled him to raise funds from ansaldo  and other companies to create il popolo ditalia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.

on both sides there was large scale fundraising for soldiers welfare, their dependents and for those injured. the nail men were a german example. around the british empire there were many patriotic funds, including the royal patriotic fund corporation, canadian patriotic fund, queensland patriotic fund and, by , there were  funds in new zealand. at the start of the next world war the new zealand funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful and abused, but  were still functioning in .

many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. these included eugene debs in the united states and bertrand russell in britain. in the us, the espionage act of  and sedition act of  made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed disloyal. publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors, and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.a number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. although the vast majority of irish people consented to participate in the war in  and , a minority of advanced irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part. the war began amid the home rule crisis in ireland that had resurfaced in , and by july  there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in ireland. irish nationalists and marxists attempted to pursue irish independence, culminating in the easter rising of , with germany sending , rifles to ireland to stir unrest in britain. the uk government placed ireland under martial law in response to the easter rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling. however, opposition to involvement in the war increased in ireland, resulting in the conscription crisis of .

other opposition came from conscientious objectorssome socialist, some religiouswho refused to fight. in britain, , people asked for conscientious objector status. some of them, most notably prominent peace activist stephen hobhouse, refused both military and alternative service. many suffered years of prison, including solitary confinement and bread and water diets. even after the war, in britain many job advertisements were marked no conscientious objectors need apply.on  may , about , workers and soldiers of petrograd, and after them, the workers and soldiers of other russian cities, led by the bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading down with the war and all power to the soviets the mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the russian provisional government. in milan, in may , bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. the italian army was forced to enter milan with tanks and machine guns to face bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until  may when the army gained control of the city. almost  people  were killed and over  people arrested.

world war i began as a clash of thcentury technology and thcentury tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. by the end of , however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks , and aircraft.artillery also underwent a revolution. in , cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. by , indirect fire with guns  was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably, aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone.fixedwing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. to shoot down enemy planes, antiaircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. strategic bombers were created, principally by the germans and british, though the former used zeppelins as well. towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a raid to destroy the zeppelin hangars at tønder in .

the nonmilitary diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy. for the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations  into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the central powers, especially among czechs, poles, and arabs. in addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.

as late as , signs warning visitors to keep off certain paths at battlefield sites like verdun and somme remained in place as unexploded ordnance continued to pose a danger to farmers living near former battlegrounds. in france and belgium locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units. in some places, plant life has still not returned to normal.

 the first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war; this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway more than a century later. teaching world war i has presented special challenges. when compared with world war ii, the first world war is often thought to be a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons. it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterizes the second world war. lacking recognizable heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking tropes like the wastefulness of war, the folly of generals and the innocence of soldiers. the complexity of the conflict is mostly obscured by these oversimplifications. george kennan referred to the war as the seminal catastrophe of the th century.historian heather jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, medical science, gender and mental health. furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated why the war began, why the allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.

memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the commonwealth war graves commission, the american battle monuments commission, the german war graves commission, and le souvenir français. many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the menin gate memorial to the missing and the thiepval memorial to the missing of the somme.in , john mccrae, a canadian army doctor, wrote the poem in flanders fields as a salute to those who perished in the great war. published in punch on  december , it is still recited today, especially on remembrance day and memorial day.

national world war i museum and memorial in kansas city, missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in world war i. the liberty memorial was dedicated on  november , when the supreme allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than , people.the uk government has budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period  to . the lead body is the imperial war museum. on  august , french president françois hollande and german president joachim gauck together marked the centenary of germanys declaration of war on france by laying the first stone of a memorial in vieil armand, known in german as hartmannswillerkopf, for french and german soldiers killed in the war. during the armistice centenary commemorations, french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of the signing of the armistice of compiègne and unveiled a plaque to reconciliation.

world war i had a lasting impact on collective memory. it was seen by many in britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the victorian period, and across europe many regarded it as a watershed. historian samuel hynes explained

a generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like honour, glory and england, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. they were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. they rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.

this has become the most common perception of world war i, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. films such as all quiet on the western front, paths of glory and king and country have perpetuated the idea, while wartime films including camrades, poppies of flanders, and shoulder arms indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive. likewise, the art of paul nash, john nash, christopher nevinson, and henry tonks in britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular wartime artists such as muirhead bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate. several historians like john terraine, niall ferguson and gary sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and polemical views

these beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. in every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. in recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of world war i. it has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. the many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. the war is not now seen as a fight about nothing, but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. it has been acknowledged that british generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges and that it was under their command that the british army played a major part in the defeat of the germans in  a great forgotten victory.

though these views have been discounted as myths, they are common. they have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the s perceptions of the war as aimless following the contrasting second world war and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the s. the majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.writers such as ernest hemingway wrote many stories on the experiences of veterans after the war, such as the short story soldiers home, about young veteran harold krebs trying to integrate back into society.

the social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate. over  million europeans died in the war. millions suffered permanent disabilities. the war gave birth to fascism and bolshevism and destroyed the dynasties that had ruled the ottoman, habsburg, russian and german empires.the optimism of la belle époque was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the lost generation. for years afterward, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock . many more returned home with few aftereffects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflicts growing mythological status. though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. such historians as dan todman, paul fussell, and samuel heyns have all published works since the s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.

the rise of nazism and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many postwar changes. similarly, the popularity of the stabintheback legend  was a testament to the psychological state of defeated germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. this conspiracy theory of the betrayal of the german war effort by jews became common, and the german populace came to see themselves as victims. the widespread acceptance of the stabintheback theory delegitimised the weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left. the same occurred in austria which did not consider itself responsible for the outbreak of the war and claimed not to have suffered a military defeat.communist and fascist movements around europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. these feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. adolf hitler was able to gain popularity by using german discontent with the still controversial treaty of versailles. world war ii was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by world war i. furthermore, it was common for germans in the s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of world war i. american historian william rubinstein wrote that

the age of totalitarianism included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the jewish holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the communist world, other mass killings carried out by nazi germany and its allies, and also the armenian genocide of . all these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern europe as a result of world war i, without which surely neither communism nor fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.

world war ii  or the second world war was a global conflict that lasted from  to .

the vast majority of the worlds countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances the allies and the axis. many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. it was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in  to  million fatalities, mostly civilians. millions died due to genocides, including the holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. in the wake of axis defeat, germany, austria and japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against german and japanese leaders.

the causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism in europe, the spanish civil war, the second sinojapanese war, sovietjapanese border conflicts, and tensions in the aftermath of world war i. world war ii is generally considered to have begun on  september , when nazi germany, under adolf hitler, invaded poland. the united kingdom and france declared war on germany on  september. under the molotovribbentrop pact of august , germany and the soviet union had partitioned poland and marked out their spheres of influence across finland, estonia, latvia, lithuania and romania. from late  to early , in a series of campaigns and treaties, germany conquered or controlled much of continental europe, in a military alliance, called the axis, with italy, japan, and other countries. following the onset of campaigns in north africa and east africa, and the fall of france in mid, the war continued primarily between the european axis powers and british empire, with the war in the balkans, the aerial battle of britain, the blitz of the uk, and the battle of the atlantic. in june , germany led the european axis powers in an invasion of the soviet union, opening the eastern front, the largest land theatre of war in history.

japan, which aimed to dominate asia and the pacific, was at war with the republic of china by . in december , japan attacked american and british territories with nearsimultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific, including an attack on pearl harbor which resulted in the united states and the united kingdom declaring war against japan. the european axis powers declared war on the us in solidarity. japan soon conquered much of the western pacific, but its advances were halted in  after losing the critical battle of midway; germany and italy were defeated in north africa and at stalingrad in the soviet union. key setbacks in including german defeats on the eastern front, the allied invasions of sicily and italian mainland, and allied offensives in the pacificcost the axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. in , the western allies invaded germanoccupied france, while the soviet union regained its territorial losses and pushed germany and its allies back. during , japan suffered reversals in mainland asia, while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands. the war in europe concluded with the liberation of germanoccupied territories and the invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union, culminating in the fall of berlin to soviet troops, hitlers suicide, and the german unconditional surrender on  may . following the refusal of japan to surrender on the terms of the potsdam declaration, the us dropped the first atomic bombs on hiroshima on  august and nagasaki on  august. faced with imminent invasion of the japanese archipelago, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the soviet unions declared entry into the war against japan on the eve of invading manchuria, japan announced on  august its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on  september .

world war ii changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the th century and into the present. the united nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powerschina, france, the soviet union, the uk, and the usbecoming the permanent members of its security council. the soviet union and the us emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly halfcenturylong cold war. in the wake of european devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonization of africa and asia. most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

it is generally considered that, in europe, world war ii started on  september , beginning with the german invasion of poland and the united kingdom and frances declaration of war on germany two days later on  september . dates for the beginning of the pacific war include the start of the second sinojapanese war on  july , or the earlier japanese invasion of manchuria, on  september . others follow the british historian a. j. p. taylor, who held that the sinojapanese war and war in europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became world war ii in . other starting dates sometimes used for world war ii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on  october . the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september . others view the spanish civil war as the start or prelude to world war ii.the exact date of the wars end is also not universally agreed upon. it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of  august  , rather than with the formal surrender of japan on  september , which officially ended the war in asia. a peace treaty between japan and the allies was signed in . a  treaty regarding germanys future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place and resolved most postworld war ii issues. no formal peace treaty between japan and the soviet union was ever signed, although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the sovietjapanese joint declaration of , which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.

world war i had radically altered the political european map with the defeat of the central powersincluding austriahungary, germany, bulgaria, and the ottoman empireand the  bolshevik seizure of power in russia, which led to the founding of the soviet union. meanwhile, the victorious allies of world war i, such as france, belgium, italy, romania, and greece, gained territory, and new nationstates were created out of the collapse of austriahungary and the ottoman and russian empires.to prevent a future world war, the league of nations was created during the  paris peace conference. the organisations primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.despite strong pacifist sentiment after world war i, irredentist and revanchist nationalism emerged in several european states in the same period. these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the treaty of versailles. under the treaty, germany lost around  percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while german annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the countrys armed forces.

the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of , and a democratic government, later known as the weimar republic, was created. the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left. italy, as an entente ally, had made some postwar territorial gains; however, italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the united kingdom and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. from  to , the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, leftwing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power, and promising the creation of a new roman empire.

adolf hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in , eventually became the chancellor of germany in  when paul von hindenburg and the reichstag appointed him. following hindenburgs death in , hitler proclaimed himself führer of germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. meanwhile, france, to secure its alliance, allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia, which italy desired as a colonial possession. the situation was aggravated in early  when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany, and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.

the united kingdom, france and italy formed the stresa front in april  in order to contain germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that june, the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany, easing prior restrictions. the soviet union, concerned by germanys goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france. before taking effect, though, the francosoviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. the united states, concerned with events in europe and asia, passed the neutrality act in august of the same year.hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march , encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement. in october , germany and italy formed the romeberlin axis. a month later, germany and japan signed the anticomintern pact, which italy joined the following year.

the kuomintang  party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mids, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party allies and new regional warlords. in , an increasingly militaristic empire of japan, which had long sought influence in china as the first step of what its government saw as the countrys right to rule asia, staged the mukden incident as a pretext to invade manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo.china appealed to the league of nations to stop the japanese invasion of manchuria. japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria. the two nations then fought several battles, in shanghai, rehe and hebei, until the tanggu truce was signed in . thereafter, chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria, and chahar and suiyuan. after the  xian incident, the kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan.

the second italoethiopian war was a brief colonial war that began in october  and ended in may . the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire  by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy , which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea. the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa ; in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace. both italy and ethiopia were member nations, but the league did little when the former clearly violated article x of the leagues covenant. the united kingdom and france supported imposing sanctions on italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the italian invasion. italy subsequently dropped its objections to germanys goal of absorbing austria.

when civil war broke out in spain, hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels, led by general francisco franco. italy supported the nationalists to a greater extent than the nazis did altogether mussolini sent to spain more than , ground troops and , aviation personnel, as well as about  aircraft. the soviet union supported the existing government of the spanish republic. more than , foreign volunteers, known as the international brigades, also fought against the nationalists. both germany and the soviet union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. the nationalists won the civil war in april ; franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during world war ii but generally favoured the axis. his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front.

in july , japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident, which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china. the soviets quickly signed a nonaggression pact with china to lend materiel support, effectively ending chinas prior cooperation with germany. from september to november, the japanese attacked taiyuan, engaged the kuomintang army around xinkou, and fought communist forces in pingxingguan. generalissimo chiang kaishek deployed his best army to defend shanghai, but after three months of fighting, shanghai fell. the japanese continued to push the chinese forces back, capturing the capital nanking in december . after the fall of nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the japanese.in march , nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang, but then the city of xuzhou was taken by the japanese in may. in june , chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river; this manoeuvre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan, but the city was taken by october. japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war.

in the midtolate s, japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and mongolia. the japanese doctrine of hokushinron, which emphasised japans expansion northward, was favoured by the imperial army during this time. with the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in , the ongoing second sinojapanese war and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april , and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshinron, promoted by the navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the united states and the western allies.

in europe, germany and italy were becoming more aggressive. in march , germany annexed austria, again provoking little response from other european powers. encouraged, hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland, an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population. soon the united kingdom and france followed the appeasement policy of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement, which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. soon afterwards, germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary, and poland annexed the transolza region of czechoslovakia.although all of germanys stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation. in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish warmongers and in january  secretly ordered a major buildup of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy. in march , germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a progerman client state, the slovak republic. hitler also delivered an ultimatum to lithuania on  march , forcing the concession of the klaipėda region, formerly the german memelland.greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig, the united kingdom and france guaranteed their support for polish independence; when italy conquered albania in april , the same guarantee was extended to the kingdoms of romania and greece. shortly after the francobritish pledge to poland, germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel. hitler accused the united kingdom and poland of trying to encircle germany and renounced the anglogerman naval agreement and the germanpolish nonaggression pact.the situation reached a general crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border. on  august, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between france, the united kingdom and soviet union stalled, the soviet union signed a nonaggression pact with germany. this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet spheres of influence , and raised the question of continuing polish independence. the pact neutralised the possibility of soviet opposition to a campaign against poland and assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a twofront war, as it had in world war i. immediately after that, hitler ordered the attack to proceed on  august, but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, germany made demands on poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations. on  august, hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession. the poles refused to comply with the german demands, and on the night of  august in a confrontational meeting with the british ambassador nevile henderson, ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected.

on  september , germany invaded poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion. the first german attack of the war came against the polish defenses at westerplatte. the united kingdom responded with an ultimatum to germany to cease military operations, and on  september, after the ultimatum was ignored, britain and france declared war on germany, followed by australia, new zealand, south africa, and canada. during the phoney war period, the alliance provided no direct military support to poland, outside of a cautious french probe into the saarland. the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany, which aimed to damage the countrys economy and the war effort. germany responded by ordering uboat warfare against allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the battle of the atlantic.on  september, german troops reached the suburbs of warsaw. the polish counteroffensive to the west halted the german advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the wehrmacht. remnants of the polish army broke through to besieged warsaw. on  september , two days after signing a ceasefire with japan, the soviet union invaded poland under the pretext that the polish state had ostensibly ceased to exist. on  september, the warsaw garrison surrendered to the germans, and the last large operational unit of the polish army surrendered on  october. despite the military defeat, poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the polish governmentinexile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied poland. a significant part of polish military personnel evacuated to romania and latvia; many of them later fought against the axis in other theatres of the war.germany annexed the western and occupied the central part of poland, and the soviet union annexed its eastern part; small shares of polish territory were transferred to lithuania and slovakia. on  october, hitler made a public peace overture to the united kingdom and france but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union. the proposal was rejected, and hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france, which was postponed until the spring of  due to bad weather.

after the outbreak of war in poland, stalin threatened estonia, latvia, and lithuania with military invasion, forcing the three baltic countries to sign pacts that stipulated the creation of soviet military bases in these countries. in october , significant soviet military contingents were moved there. finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the soviet union. the soviet union invaded finland in november , and was subsequently expelled from the league of nations for this crime of aggression. despite overwhelming numerical superiority, soviet military success during the winter war was modest, and the finnosoviet war ended in march  with some finnish concessions of territory.in june , the soviet union occupied the entire territories of estonia, latvia and lithuania, and the romanian regions of bessarabia, northern bukovina, and the hertsa region. in august , hitler imposed the second vienna award on romania which led to the transfer of northern transylvania to hungary. in september , bulgaria demanded southern dobruja from romania with german and italian support, leading to the treaty of craiova. the loss of onethird of romanias  territory caused a coup against king carol ii, turning romania into a fascist dictatorship under marshal ion antonescu with a course set firmly towards the axis in the hopes of a german guarantee. meanwhile, germansoviet political rapprochement and economic cooperation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.

in april , germany invaded denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden, which the allies were attempting to cut off. denmark capitulated after six hours, and norway was conquered within two months despite allied support. british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the resignation of prime minister neville chamberlain, who was replaced by winston churchill on  may .on the same day, germany launched an offensive against france. to circumvent the strong maginot line fortifications on the francogerman border, germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of belgium, the netherlands, and luxembourg. the germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the ardennes region, which was mistakenly perceived by the allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. by successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics, the wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the channel and cut off the allied forces in belgium, trapping the bulk of the allied armies in a cauldron on the francobelgian border near lille. the united kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of allied troops from the continent by early june, although abandoning almost all their equipment.on  june, italy invaded france, declaring war on both france and the united kingdom. the germans turned south against the weakened french army, and paris fell to them on  june. eight days later france signed an armistice with germany; it was divided into german and italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with germany. france kept its fleet, which the united kingdom attacked on  july in an attempt to prevent its seizure by germany.

the air battle of britain began in early july with luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours. the united kingdom rejected hitlers peace offer, and the german air superiority campaign started in august but failed to defeat raf fighter command, forcing the indefinite postponement of the proposed german invasion of britain. the german strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz, but failed to significantly disrupt the british war effort and largely ended in may .using newly captured french ports, the german navy enjoyed success against an overextended royal navy, using uboats against british shipping in the atlantic. the british home fleet scored a significant victory on  may  by sinking the german battleship bismarck.in november , the united states was taking measures to assist china and the western allies and amended the neutrality act to allow cash and carry purchases by the allies. in , following the german capture of paris, the size of the united states navy was significantly increased. in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases. still, a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into . in december , roosevelt accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the united states to become an arsenal of democracy and promoting lendlease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the british war effort, which was later extended to the other allies, including the soviet union after it was invaded by germany. the united states started strategic planning to prepare for a fullscale offensive against germany.at the end of september , the tripartite pact formally united japan, italy, and germany as the axis powers. the tripartite pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the soviet union, which attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three. the axis expanded in november  when hungary, slovakia, and romania joined. romania and hungary later made major contributions to the axis war against the soviet union, in romanias case partially to recapture territory ceded to the soviet union.

in early june , the italian regia aeronautica attacked and besieged malta, a british possession. from late summer to early autumn, italy conquered british somaliland and made an incursion into britishheld egypt. in october, italy attacked greece, but the attack was repulsed with heavy italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes. germany started preparation for an invasion of the balkans to assist italy, to prevent the british from gaining a foothold there, which would be a potential threat for romanian oil fields, and to strike against the british dominance of the mediterranean.

in december , british empire forces began counteroffensives against italian forces in egypt and italian east africa. the offensives were highly successful; by early february , italy had lost control of eastern libya, and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner. the italian navy also suffered significant defeats, with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission by means of a carrier attack at taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the battle of cape matapan.italian defeats prompted germany to deploy an expeditionary force to north africa and at the end of march , rommels afrika korps launched an offensive which drove back the commonwealth forces. in under a month, axis forces advanced to western egypt and besieged the port of tobruk.by late march , bulgaria and yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact; however, the yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by probritish nationalists. germany and italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both yugoslavia and greece, commencing on  april ; both nations were forced to surrender within the month. the airborne invasion of the greek island of crete at the end of may completed the german conquest of the balkans. although the axis victory was swift, bitter and largescale partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the axis occupation of yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.in the middle east in may, commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichycontrolled syria. between june and july, britishled forces invaded and occupied the french possessions of syria and lebanon, assisted by the free french.

with the situation in europe and asia relatively stable, germany, japan, and the soviet union made preparations for war. with the soviets wary of mounting tensions with germany and the japanese planning to take advantage of the european war by seizing resourcerich european possessions in southeast asia, the two powers signed the sovietjapanese neutrality pact in april . by contrast, the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union, massing forces on the soviet border.hitler believed that the united kingdoms refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany sooner or later. on  july , hitler decided that the soviet union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of ukraine, the baltic states and byelorussia. however, other senior german officials like ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a euroasian bloc against the british empire by inviting the soviet union into the tripartite pact. in november , negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the pact. the soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from finland, bulgaria, turkey, and japan that germany considered unacceptable. on  december , hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the soviet union.on  june , germany, supported by italy and romania, invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa, with germany accusing the soviets of plotting against them. they were joined shortly by finland and hungary. the primary targets of this surprise offensive were the baltic region, moscow and ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the  campaign near the arkhangelskastrakhan line, from the caspian to the white seas. hitlers objectives were to eliminate the soviet union as a military power, exterminate communism, generate lebensraum  by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat germanys remaining rivals.although the red army was preparing for strategic counteroffensives before the war, operation barbarossa forced the soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. during the summer, the axis made significant gains into soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. by midaugust, however, the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre, and to divert the nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad. the  kyiv offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies, and made possible further advance into crimea and industrially developed eastern ukraine .

the diversion of threequarters of the axis troops and the majority of their air forces from france and the central mediterranean to the eastern front prompted the united kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy. in july, the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany and in august, the united kingdom and the united states jointly issued the atlantic charter, which outlined british and american goals for the postwar world. in late august the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor, irans oil fields, and preempt any axis advances through iran toward the baku oil fields or india.by october, axis operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of leningrad and sevastopol continuing. a major offensive against moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the german army almost reached the outer suburbs of moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. large territorial gains were made by axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives two key cities remained in soviet hands, the soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential. the blitzkrieg phase of the war in europe had ended.by early december, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the soviets to achieve numerical parity with axis troops. this, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwantung army, allowed the soviets to begin a massive counteroffensive that started on  december all along the front and pushed german troops  kilometres  west.

following the japanese false flag mukden incident in , the japanese shelling of the american gunboat uss panay in , and the  nanjing massacre, japaneseamerican relations deteriorated. in , the united states notified japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and american public opinion opposing japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions, the export control acts, which banned u.s. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to japan and increased economic pressure on the japanese regime. during  japan launched its first attack against changsha, a strategically important chinese city, but was repulsed by late september. despite several offensives by both sides, the war between china and japan was stalemated by . to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes, and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers, japan invaded and occupied northern indochina in september .chinese nationalist forces launched a largescale counteroffensive in early . in august, chinese communists launched an offensive in central china; in retaliation, japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. the continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january , effectively ending their cooperation. in march, the japanese th army attacked the headquarters of the chinese th army but was repulsed during battle of shanggao. in september, japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces.german successes in europe encouraged japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia. the dutch government agreed to provide japan with some oil supplies from the dutch east indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june . in july  japan sent troops to southern indochina, thus threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east. the united states, the united kingdom, and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo. at the same time, japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east, intending to capitalise off the german invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.since early , the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china. during these negotiations, japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate. at the same time the united states, the united kingdom, and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a japanese attack against any of them. roosevelt reinforced the philippines  and warned japan that the united states would react to japanese attacks against any neighboring countries.

frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the americanbritishdutch sanctions, japan prepared for war. emperor hirohito, after initial hesitation about japans chances of victory, began to favour japans entry into the war. as a result, prime minister fumimaro konoe resigned. hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint prince naruhiko higashikuni in his place, choosing war minister hideki tojo instead. on  november, nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on pearl harbor to the emperor. on  november, hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war. on  november, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to japan. in exchange, japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina. the american counterproposal of  november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude nonaggression pacts with all pacific powers. that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force; the japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.japan planned to seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific. the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the overstretched allies by fighting a defensive war. to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset. on  december  , japan attacked british and american holdings with nearsimultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific. these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines, as well as invasions of guam, wake island, malaya, thailand, and hong kong.the japanese invasion of thailand led to thailands decision to ally itself with japan and the other japanese attacks led the united states, united kingdom, china, australia, and several other states to formally declare war on japan, whereas the soviet union, being heavily involved in largescale hostilities with european axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with japan. germany, followed by the other axis states, declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan, citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt.

on  january , the allied big fourthe soviet union, china, the united kingdom, and the united statesand  smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations, thereby affirming the atlantic charter, and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers.during , allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective. the americans favoured a straightforward, largescale attack on germany through france. the soviets were also demanding a second front. the british, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using largescale armies. eventually, the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in  and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa.at the casablanca conference in early , the allies reiterated the statements issued in the  declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes. although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war, in may , the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in .

by the end of april , japan and its ally thailand had almost fully conquered burma, malaya, the dutch east indies, singapore, and rabaul, inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. despite stubborn resistance by filipino and u.s. forces, the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may , forcing its government into exile. on  april, in burma, , british soldiers were encircled by the japanese rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese th division. japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the south china sea, java sea, and indian ocean, and bombed the allied naval base at darwin, australia. in january , the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha. these easy victories over the unprepared u.s. and european opponents left japan overconfident, as well as overextended.in early may , japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia. the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force, centred on two american fleet carriers, fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea. japans next plan, motivated by the earlier doolittle raid, was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska. in midmay, japan started the zhejiangjiangxi campaign in china, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying chinese air bases and fighting against the chinese rd and nd army groups. in early june, japan put its operations into action, but the americans, having broken japanese naval codes in late may, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy.with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle, japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua. the americans planned a counterattack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands, primarily guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing rabaul, the main japanese base in southeast asia.both plans started in july, but by midseptember, the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese, and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of bunagona. guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for guadalcanal. by the start of , the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops. in burma, commonwealth forces mounted two operations. the first, an offensive into the arakan region in late , went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to india by may . the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese frontlines in february which, by the end of april, had achieved mixed results.

despite considerable losses, in early  germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. in may, the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern russia in june , to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy the kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. the germans split army group south into two groups army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck southeast to the caucasus, while army group b headed towards the volga river. the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga.by midnovember, the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting. the soviets began their second winter counteroffensive, starting with an encirclement of german forces at stalingrad, and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. by early february , the german army had taken tremendous losses; german troops at stalingrad had been defeated, and the frontline had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. in midfebruary, after the soviet push had tapered off, the germans launched another attack on kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the soviet city of kursk.

exploiting poor american naval command decisions, the german navy ravaged allied shipping off the american atlantic coast. by november , commonwealth forces had launched a counteroffensive, operation crusader, in north africa, and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made. in north africa, the germans launched an offensive in january, pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february, followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. concerns the japanese might use bases in vichyheld madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may . an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein. on the continent, raids of allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous dieppe raid, demonstrated the western allies inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.in august , the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta. a few months later, the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt, dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya. this attack was followed up shortly after by angloamerican landings in french north africa, which resulted in the region joining the allies. hitler responded to the french colonys defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france; although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces. the axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia, which was conquered by the allies in may .in june , the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and dehouse the civilian population. the firebombing of hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.

after the guadalcanal campaign, the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific. in may , canadian and u.s. forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians. soon after, the united states, with support from australia, new zealand and pacific islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands. by the end of march , the allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands. in april, the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea.in the soviet union, both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of  preparing for large offensives in central russia. on  july , germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge. within a week, german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets deeply echeloned and wellconstructed defences, and for the first time in the war, hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. this decision was partially affected by the western allies invasion of sicily launched on  july, which, combined with previous italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month.on  july , the soviets launched their own counteroffensives, thereby dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east. the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority, giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front. the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified pantherwotan line, but the soviets broke through it at smolensk and by the lower dnieper offensive.on  september , the western allies invaded the italian mainland, following italys armistice with the allies and the ensuing german occupation of italy. germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines. german special forces then rescued mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in germanoccupied italy named the italian social republic, causing an italian civil war. the western allies fought through several lines until reaching the main german defensive line in midnovember.

german operations in the atlantic also suffered. by may , as allied countermeasures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign. in november , franklin d. roosevelt and winston churchill met with chiang kaishek in cairo and then with joseph stalin in tehran. the former conference determined the postwar return of japanese territory and the military planning for the burma campaign, while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in  and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germanys defeat.from november , during the sevenweek battle of changde, the chinese forced japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting allied relief. in january , the allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at anzio.on  january , soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region, thereby ending the most lethal siege in history. the following soviet offensive was halted on the prewar estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to reestablish national independence. this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region. by late may , the soviets had liberated crimea, largely expelled axis forces from ukraine, and made incursions into romania, which were repulsed by the axis troops. the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat, rome was captured on june .the allies had mixed success in mainland asia. in march , the japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against allied positions in assam, india, and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima. in may , british and indian forces mounted a counteroffensive that drove japanese troops back to burma by july, and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late  besieged japanese troops in myitkyina. the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy chinas main fighting forces, secure railways between japaneseheld territory and capture allied airfields. by june, the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha.

on  june  , after three years of soviet pressure, the western allies invaded northern france. after reassigning several allied divisions from italy, they also attacked southern france. these landings were successful and led to the defeat of the german army units in france. paris was liberated on  august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces, both led by general charles de gaulle, and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year. an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed. after that, the western allies slowly pushed into germany, but failed to cross the rur river in a large offensive. in italy, the allied advance also slowed due to the last major german defensive line.on  june, the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus  that almost destroyed the german army group centre. soon after that, another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland. the soviets formed the polish committee of national liberation to control territory in poland and combat the polish armia krajowa; the soviet red army remained in the praga district on the other side of the vistula and watched passively as the germans quelled the warsaw uprising initiated by the armia krajowa. the national uprising in slovakia was also quelled by the germans. the soviet red armys strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup détat in romania and in bulgaria, followed by those countries shift to the allied side.

in september , soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece, albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. by this point, the communistled partisans under marshal josip broz tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since , controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south. in northern serbia, the soviet red army, with limited support from bulgarian forces, assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on  october. a few days later, the soviets launched a massive assault against germanoccupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february . unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans, bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a sovietfinnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although finland was forced to fight their former german allies.by the start of july , commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam, pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river while the chinese captured myitkyina. in september , chinese forces captured mount song and reopened the burma road. in china, the japanese had more successes, having finally captured changsha in midjune and the city of hengyang by early august. soon after, they invaded the province of guangxi, winning major engagements against chinese forces at guilin and liuzhou by the end of november and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by middecember.in the pacific, u.s. forces continued to press back the japanese perimeter. in midjune , they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea. these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister, hideki tojo, and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands. in late october, american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte; soon after, allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.

on  december , germany made a last attempt on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counteroffensive in the ardennes and along the frenchgerman border to split the western allies, encircle large portions of western allied troops and capture their primary supply port at antwerp to prompt a political settlement. by  january , the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. in italy, the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line. in midjanuary , the red army attacked in poland, pushing from the vistula to the oder river in germany, and overran east prussia. on  february soviet, british, and u.s. leaders met for the yalta conference. they agreed on the occupation of postwar germany, and on when the soviet union would join the war against japan.in february, the soviets entered silesia and pomerania, while the western allies entered western germany and closed to the rhine river. by march, the western allies crossed the rhine north and south of the ruhr, encircling the german army group b. in early march, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in hungary and to retake budapest, germany launched its last major offensive against soviet troops near lake balaton. in two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the soviets advanced to vienna, and captured the city. in early april, soviet troops captured königsberg, while the western allies finally pushed forward in italy and swept across western germany capturing hamburg and nuremberg. american and soviet forces met at the elbe river on  april, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern germany and around berlin.

soviet troops stormed and captured berlin in late april. in italy, german forces surrendered on  april. on  april, the reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of nazi germany, and the berlin garrison surrendered on  may.

major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. on  april, president roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, harry s. truman. benito mussolini was killed by italian partisans on  april. on  april, hitler committed suicide in his headquarters, and he was succeeded by grand admiral karl dönitz and joseph goebbels. total and unconditional surrender in europe was signed on  and  may, to be effective by the end of  may. german army group centre resisted in prague until  may.in the pacific theatre, american forces accompanied by the forces of the philippine commonwealth advanced in the philippines, clearing leyte by the end of april . they landed on luzon in january  and recaptured manila in march. fighting continued on luzon, mindanao, and other islands of the philippines until the end of the war. meanwhile, the united states army air forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in japan in an effort to destroy japanese war industry and civilian morale. a devastating bombing raid on tokyo of  march was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.

in may , australian troops landed in borneo, overrunning the oilfields there. british, american, and chinese forces defeated the japanese in northern burma in march, and the british pushed on to reach rangoon by  may. chinese forces started a counterattack in the battle of west hunan that occurred between  april and  june . american naval and amphibious forces also moved towards japan, taking iwo jima by march, and okinawa by the end of june. at the same time, a naval blockade by submarines was strangling japans economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.on  july, allied leaders met in potsdam, germany. they confirmed earlier agreements about germany, and the american, british and chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of japan, specifically stating that the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction. during this conference, the united kingdom held its general election, and clement attlee replaced churchill as prime minister.the call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms. in early august, the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki. between the two bombings, the soviets, pursuant to the yalta agreement, invaded japaneseheld manchuria and quickly defeated the kwantung army, which was the largest japanese fighting force. these two events persuaded previously adamant imperial army leaders to accept surrender terms. the red army also captured the southern part of sakhalin island and the kuril islands. on the night of  august , emperor hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the allies in the potsdam declaration. on  august, the emperor communicated this decision to the japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio . on  august , japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship uss missouri on  september , ending the war.

the allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union, respectively. however, their paths soon diverged. in germany, the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union officially ended in , with the respective zones becoming separate countries, west germany and east germany. in austria, however, occupation continued until , when a joint settlement between the western allies and the soviet union permitted the reunification of austria as a neutral democratic state, officially nonaligned with any political bloc . a denazification program in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of exnazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and reintegration of exnazis into west german society.germany lost a quarter of its prewar  territory. among the eastern territories, silesia, neumark and most of pomerania were taken over by poland, and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union, followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces, as well as three million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. by the s, onefifth of west germans were refugees from the east. the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line, from which  million poles were expelled; northeast romania, parts of eastern finland, and the three baltic states were annexed into the soviet union. italy lost its monarchy, colonial empire and some european territories.in an effort to maintain world peace, the allies formed the united nations, which officially came into existence on  october , and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in  as a common standard for all member nations. the great powers that were the victors of the warfrance, china, the united kingdom, the soviet union and the united statesbecame the permanent members of the uns security council. the five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the republic of china and the peoples republic of china in , and between the soviet union and its successor state, the russian federation, following the dissolution of the ussr in . the alliance between the western allies and the soviet union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.

besides germany, the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence. most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere, which led to establishment of communistled regimes, with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities. as a result, east germany, poland, hungary, romania, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, and albania became soviet satellite states. communist yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the soviet union. a communist uprising in greece was put down with angloamerican support and the country remained aligned with the west.postwar division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the united statesled nato and the sovietled warsaw pact. the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the cold war, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.in asia, the united states led the occupation of japan and administered japans former islands in the western pacific, while the soviets annexed south sakhalin and the kuril islands. korea, formerly under japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the united states in the south between  and . separate republics emerged on both sides of the th parallel in , each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of korea, which led ultimately to the korean war.in china, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in june . communist forces were victorious and established the peoples republic of china on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in . in the middle east, the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the escalation of the arabisraeli conflict. while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.the global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. the united states emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by  its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy. the allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in western germany from  to . due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in europe and delayed european recovery from the war for several years.at the bretton woods conference in july , the allied nations drew up an economic framework for the postwar world. the agreement created the international monetary fund  and the international bank for reconstruction and development , which later became part of the world bank group. the bretton woods system lasted until . recovery began with the mid currency reform in western germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of european economic policy that the u.s. marshall plan economic aid  both directly and indirectly caused. the post west german recovery has been called the german economic miracle. italy also experienced an economic boom and the french economy rebounded. by contrast, the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin, and although receiving a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance, more than any other european country, it continued in relative economic decline for decades. the soviet union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate postwar era, having seized and transferred most of germanys industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states. japan recovered much later. china returned to its prewar industrial production by .

estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. most suggest that some  million people died in the war, including about  million military personnel and  million civilians.the soviet union alone lost around  million people during the war, including . million military and  million civilian deaths. a quarter of the total people in the soviet union were wounded or killed. germany sustained . million military losses, mostly on the eastern front and during the final battles in germany.an estimated  to  million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of hitlers racist policies, including mass killing of around  million jews, along with roma, homosexuals, at least . million ethnic poles and millions of other slavs , and other ethnic and minority groups. between  and , more than , ethnic serbs, along with gypsies and jews, were persecuted and murdered by the axisaligned croatian ustaše in yugoslavia. concurrently, muslims and croats were persecuted and killed by serb nationalist chetniks, with an estimated ,, victims . also, more than , poles were massacred by the ukrainian insurgent army in the volhynia massacres, between  and . at the same time, about ,, ukrainians were killed by the polish home army and other polish units, in reprisal attacks.

in asia and the pacific, the number of people killed by japanese troops remains contested. according to r.j. rummel, the japanese killed between  million and more than  million people, with the most probable case of almost ,, people. according to the british historian m. r. d. foot, civilian deaths are between  million and  million, whereas chinese military casualties  are estimated to be over five million. other estimates say that up to  million people, most of them civilians, were killed. the most infamous japanese atrocity was the nanking massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were raped and murdered. mitsuyoshi himeta reported that . million casualties occurred during the sankō sakusen. general yasuji okamura implemented the policy in heipei and shantung.axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china  and in early conflicts against the soviets. both the germans and the japanese tested such weapons against civilians, and sometimes on prisoners of war.the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of , polish officers, and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to siberia, in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army. soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in germany. the exact number of german women and girls raped by soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million, while figures for women raped by german soldiers in the soviet union go as far as ten million.the mass bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war ii. the usaaf bombed a total of  japanese cities, killing , civilians, including from the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki, and destroying  of builtup areas.

nazi germany, under the dictatorship of adolf hitler, was responsible for murdering about  million jews in what is now known as the holocaust. they also murdered an additional  million others who were deemed unworthy of life  as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a genocidal state. soviet pows were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and . million soviet pows out of . million died in nazi camps during the war. in addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in nazi germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. nazi germany extensively used forced labourers; about  million europeans from germanoccupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in german industry, agriculture and war economy.the soviet gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during , when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates, including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied in  by the soviet union, as well as axis pows. by the end of the war, most soviet pows liberated from nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to nkvd evaluation, and , were sent to the gulag as real or perceived nazi collaborators.japanese prisonerofwar camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was  percent , seven times that of pows under the germans and italians. while , prisoners from the uk, , from the netherlands, and , from the united states were released after the surrender of japan, the number of chinese released was only .at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between  and  by the east asia development board, or kōain, for work in mines and war industries. after , the number reached  million. in java, between  and  million rōmusha , were forced to work by the japanese military. about , of these javanese labourers were sent to other japaneseheld areas in southeast asia, and only , were repatriated to java.

in europe, occupation came under two forms. in western, northern, and central europe  germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly . billion reichsmarks  by the end of the war; this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. thus, the income from occupied nations was over  percent of the income germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly  percent of total german income as the war went on.in the east, the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating frontlines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders. unlike in the west, the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the inferior people of slavic descent; most german advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes. the nazis killed an estimated . million ethnic poles during the war in addition to polishjewish victims of the holocaust. although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper german operations in either the east or the west until late .

in asia, japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia coprosperity sphere, essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. although japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from european domination, japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them. during japans initial conquest, it captured ,, barrels  of oil  left behind by retreating allied forces; and by , was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to  million barrels  of oil ,  percent of its  output rate.

in europe, before the outbreak of the war, the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. in , the western allies  had a  percent larger population and a  percent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers ; if colonies are included, the allies had more than a  advantage in population and a nearly  advantage in gdp. in asia at the same time, china had roughly six times the population of japan but only an  percent higher gdp; this is reduced to three times the population and only a  percent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included.the united states produced about twothirds of all the munitions used by the allies in world war ii, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.

though the allies economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan, they became the decisive factor by , after the united states and soviet union joined the allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. while the allies ability to outproduce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as germany and japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force, allied strategic bombing, and germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. additionally, neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so. to improve their production, germany and japan used millions of slave labourers; germany used about  million people, mostly from eastern europe, while japan used more than  million people in far east asia.

aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and groundsupport, and each role developed considerably. innovations included airlift ; and strategic bombing . antiaircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surfacetoair artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at taranto, pearl harbor, and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship . in the atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the midatlantic gap. carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and not requiring to be as heavily armoured. submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war, were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. the british focused development on antisubmarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics. gradually, improving allied technologies such as the leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved effective against german submarines.land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of world war i, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. the tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war, had evolved into the primary weapon. in the late s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower. at the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and german doctrine of avoiding tankversustank combat. this, along with germanys use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france. many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, antitank guns , mines, shortranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. even with largescale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i. the portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the german mg , and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings. the assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.

most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most wellknown being the german enigma machine. development of sigint  and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes and british ultra, a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau, which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war. another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the allies used to great effect, such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard.other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the worlds first programmable computers , guided missiles and modern rockets, the manhattan projects development of nuclear weapons, operations research, the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel. penicillin was first developed, massproduced and used during the war.

as heir apparent, charles undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother. he founded the princes trust in , sponsored the princes charities, and became patron or president of more than  other charities and organisations. he advocated for the conservation of historic buildings and the importance of architecture in society. in that vein, he generated the experimental new town of poundbury. an environmentalist, charles supported organic farming and action to prevent climate change during his time as the manager of the duchy of cornwall estates, earning him awards and recognition as well as criticism; he is also a prominent critic of the adoption of genetically modified food, while his support for alternative medicine has been criticised. he has authored or coauthored  books.

charles became king upon his mothers death on  september . at the age of , he became the oldest person to accede to the british throne, after having been the longestserving heir apparent and prince of wales in british history. his coronation took place at westminster abbey on  may .

charles was born at   on  november , during the reign of his maternal grandfather, king george vi. he was the first child of princess elizabeth, duchess of edinburgh , and philip, duke of edinburgh. his parents had three more children, anne , andrew  and edward . on  december , at four weeks old, he was christened charles philip arthur george in the music room of buckingham palace by the archbishop of canterbury, geoffrey fisher.george vi died on  february  and charless mother acceded to the throne as elizabeth ii; charles immediately became the heir apparent. under a charter of edward iii in , and as the monarchs eldest son, he automatically assumed the traditional titles of duke of cornwall and, in the scottish peerage, the titles duke of rothesay, earl of carrick, baron of renfrew, lord of the isles, and prince and great steward of scotland. on  june the following year, charles attended his mothers coronation at westminster abbey.when charles turned five, a governess, catherine peebles, was appointed to oversee his education at buckingham palace. charles then commenced classes at hill house school in west london on  november . he was the first heir apparent to attend school, rather than be educated by a private tutor. he did not receive preferential treatment from the schools founder and headmaster, stuart townend, who advised the queen to have charles train in football, because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field. charles subsequently attended two of his fathers former schools cheam school in hampshire, from , followed by gordonstoun, in the northeast of scotland, beginning classes there in april .

in his  authorised biography by jonathan dimbleby, charless parents were described as physically and emotionally distant and philip was blamed for his disregard of charless sensitive nature, including forcing him to attend gordonstoun, where he was bullied. though charles reportedly described gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as colditz in kilts, he later praised the school, stating it had taught him a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities. he said in a  interview he was glad he had attended gordonstoun and that the toughness of the place was much exaggerated. in , charles spent two terms at the timbertop campus of geelong grammar school in victoria, australia, during which time he visited papua new guinea on a school trip with his history tutor, michael collins persse. in , charles described his time at timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education. upon his return to gordonstoun, charles emulated his father in becoming head boy and left in , with six gce olevels and two alevels in history and french, at grades b and c respectively. on his education, charles later remarked, i didnt enjoy school as much as i might have; but, that was only because im happier at home than anywhere else.charles broke royal tradition when he proceeded straight to university after his alevels, rather than joining the british armed forces. in october , he was admitted to trinity college, cambridge, where he studied archaeology and anthropology for the first part of the tripos and then switched to history for the second part. during his second year, charles attended the university college of wales in aberystwyth, studying welsh history and the welsh language for one term. charles became the first british heir apparent to earn a university degree, graduating on  june  from the university of cambridge with a  bachelor of arts  degree. following standard practice, on  august , his bachelor of arts was promoted to a master of arts  degree.

charles was created prince of wales and earl of chester on  july , though his investiture was not held until  july , when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at caernarfon castle; the investiture was controversial in wales owing to growing welsh nationalist sentiment. he took his seat in the house of lords the following year and he delivered his maiden speech on  june , the first royal to speak from the floor since the future edward vii in . he spoke again in .charles began to take on more public duties, founding the princes trust in  and travelling to the united states in . in the mids, charles expressed an interest in serving as governorgeneral of australia, at the suggestion of australian prime minister malcolm fraser; however, because of a lack of public enthusiasm, nothing came of the proposal. in reaction, charles commented, so, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told youre not wanted

charles served in the royal air force  and the royal navy. during his second year at cambridge, he received royal air force training, learning to fly the chipmunk aircraft with the cambridge university air squadron, and was presented with his raf wings in august .

in his youth, charles was amorously linked to a number of women. his girlfriends included georgiana russell, the daughter of sir john russell, who was the british ambassador to spain; lady jane wellesley, the daughter of the th duke of wellington; davina sheffield; lady sarah spencer; and camilla shand, who later became his second wife.

charless greatuncle lord mountbatten advised him to sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but, for a wife, he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweetcharactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for ... it is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage. early in , mountbatten began corresponding with yearold charles about a potential marriage to amanda knatchbull, mountbattens granddaughter. charles wrote to amandas mother, lady brabourne, who was also his godmother, expressing interest in her daughter. lady brabourne replied approvingly; though, she suggested that a courtship with a yearold was premature. four years later, mountbatten arranged for amanda and himself to accompany charles on his  visit to india. both fathers, however, objected; prince philip feared that his famous uncle would eclipse charles, while lord brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.in august , before charles would depart alone for india, mountbatten was assassinated by the irish republican army. when charles returned, he proposed to amanda. but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.

charless cousin norton knatchbull and his wife told charles that diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her. meanwhile, the couples continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. when philip told him that the media speculation would injure dianas reputation if charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride , charles construed his fathers advice as a warning to proceed without further delay. he proposed to diana in february , with their engagement becoming official on  february; the wedding took place in st pauls cathedral on  july. upon his marriage, charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits of the duchy of cornwall from  per cent to  per cent. the couple lived at kensington palace and highgrove house, near tetbury, and had two children william, in , and harry, in .within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couples incompatibility and near year age difference. by november , charles had fully resumed his affair with camilla parker bowles. in a videotape recorded by peter settelen in , diana admitted that she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. it was assumed that she was referring to barry mannakee, who had been transferred to the diplomatic protection squad in , after his managers determined his relationship with diana had been inappropriate. diana later commenced a relationship with major james hewitt, the familys former riding instructor.charles and dianas evident discomfort in each others company led to them being dubbed the glums by the press. diana exposed charless affair with parker bowles in a book by andrew morton, diana her true story. audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced, as did persistent suggestions that hewitt is prince harrys father, based on a physical similarity between hewitt and harry. however, harry had already been born by the time dianas affair with hewitt began.in december , john major announced the couples legal separation in the house of commons. early the following year, the british press published transcripts of a passionate, bugged telephone conversation between charles and parker bowles that had taken place in , which was dubbed camillagate and tampongate. charles subsequently sought public understanding in a television film with dimbleby, charles the private man, the public role, broadcast on  june . in an interview in the film, charles confirmed his own extramarital affair with parker bowles, saying that he had rekindled their association in , only after his marriage to diana had irretrievably broken down. this was followed by dianas own admission of marital troubles in an interview on the bbc current affairs show panorama, broadcast on  november . referring to charless relationship with parker bowles, she said, well, there were three of us in this marriage. so, it was a bit crowded. she also expressed doubt about her husbands suitability for kingship. charles and diana divorced on  august , after being advised by the queen in december  to end the marriage. the couple shared custody of their children.diana was killed in a car crash in paris on  august . charles flew to paris with dianas sisters to accompany her body back to britain. in , dianas butler paul burrell published a note that he claimed had been written by diana in , in which there were allegations that charles was planning an accident in dianas car, brake failure and serious head injury, so that he could marry again. when questioned by the metropolitan police inquiry team as a part of operation paget, charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wifes note from  and could not understand why she had those feelings.

the engagement of the prince of wales and camilla parker bowles was announced on  february .  the queens consent to the marriage  as required by the royal marriages act   was recorded in a privy council meeting on  march. in canada, the department of justice determined the consent of the queens privy council for canada was not required, as the union would not produce any heirs to the canadian throne.charles was the only member of the royal family to have a civil, rather than a church, wedding in england. british government documents from the s and s, published by the bbc, stated that such a marriage was illegal; these claims were dismissed by charless spokesman and explained by the sitting government to have been repealed by the registration service act .the union was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at windsor castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at the castles st georges chapel. the wedding venue was changed to windsor guildhall after it was realised a civil marriage at windsor castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. four days before the event, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of  april until the following day in order to allow charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of pope john paul ii.charless parents did not attend the marriage ceremony; the queens reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as supreme governor of the church of england. the queen and duke of edinburgh did attend the service of blessing and held a reception for the newlyweds at windsor castle. the blessing by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams was televised.

in , charles undertook his first public engagement by attending a student garden party at the palace of holyroodhouse. during his time as prince of wales, he undertook official duties on behalf of the queen, completing , engagements between  and . he officiated at investitures and attended the funerals of foreign dignitaries. charles made regular tours of wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the senedd. the six trustees of the royal collection trust met three times a year under his chairmanship. charles also represented his mother at the independence celebrations in fiji in , the bahamas in , papua new guinea in , zimbabwe in , and brunei in .in , christopher john lewis, who had fired a shot with a . rifle at the queen in , attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate charles, who was visiting new zealand with diana and william. while charles was visiting australia on australia day in january , david kang fired two shots at him from a starting pistol in protest of the treatment of several hundred cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps. in , charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the republic of ireland in an official capacity. in , charles represented the queen at the hong kong handover ceremony.

commonwealth heads of government decided at their  meeting that charles would be the next head of the commonwealth after the queen. the head is chosen and therefore not hereditary. in march , at the request of the british government, charles and camilla went on an official tour of cuba, making them the first british royals to visit the country. the tour was seen as an effort to form a closer relationship between cuba and the uk.charles contracted covid during the pandemic in march . several newspapers were critical that charles and camilla were tested promptly at a time when many nhs doctors, nurses and patients had been unable to be tested expeditiously. he tested positive for covid for a second time in february . he and camilla, who also tested positive, had received doses of a covid vaccine in february .

charles and camillas coronation took place at westminster abbey on  may . plans had been made for many years, under the code name operation golden orb. reports before his accession suggested that charless coronation would be simpler than his mothers in , with the ceremony expected to be shorter, smaller, less expensive, and more representative of different faiths and community groups  falling in line with the kings wish to reflect the ethnic diversity of modern britain. nonetheless, the coronation was a church of england rite, including the coronation oath, the anointment, delivery of the orb, and enthronement. in july they attended a national service of thanksgiving where they were presented with the honours of scotland in st giles cathedral.charles and camilla have engaged in two state visits and received one in return. in november  they hosted the south african president, cyril ramaphosa, during the first official state visit to britain of charless reign. in march the following year, the king and queen embarked on a state visit to germany; charles became the first british monarch to address the bundestag. similarly, in september, he became the first british monarch to give a speech from frances senate chamber during his state visit to the country.

germany, officially the federal republic of germany, is a country in the western region of central europe. it is the secondmost populous country in europe after russia, and the most populous member state of the european union. germany is situated between the baltic and north seas to the north, and the alps to the south. its  constituent states are bordered by denmark to the north, poland and the czech republic to the east, austria and switzerland to the south, and france, luxembourg, belgium, and the netherlands to the west. the nations capital and most populous city is berlin and its main financial centre is frankfurt; the largest urban area is the ruhr.

various germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern germany since classical antiquity. a region named germania was documented before ad . in , the kingdom of germany formed the bulk of the holy roman empire. during the th century, northern german regions became the centre of the protestant reformation. following the napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the holy roman empire in , the german confederation was formed in .

formal unification of germany into the modern nationstate was commenced on  august  with the north german confederation treaty establishing the prussialed north german confederation later transformed in  into the german empire. after world war i and the german revolution of , the empire was in turn transformed into the semipresidential weimar republic. the nazi seizure of power in  led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, world war ii, and the holocaust. after the end of world war ii in europe and a period of allied occupation, in , germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty the federal republic of germany, generally known as west germany, and the german democratic republic, known as east germany, while berlin continued its de jure four power status. the federal republic of germany was a founding member of the european economic community and the european union, while the german democratic republic was a communist eastern bloc state and member of the warsaw pact. after the fall of communist ledgovernment in east germany, german reunification saw the former east german states join the federal republic of germany on  october .

germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in europe, the worlds thirdlargest economy by nominal gdp and the fifthlargest by ppp. as a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the worlds thirdlargest exporter and importer. as a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system and a tuitionfree university education. germany is a member of the united nations, european union, nato, council of europe, g, g, and oecd. it has the thirdgreatest number of unesco world heritage sites.

the english word germany derives from the latin germania, which came into use after julius caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the rhine. the german term deutschland, originally diutisciu land  is derived from deutsch , descended from old high german diutisc of the people , originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from latin and its romance descendants. this in turn descends from protogermanic þiudiskaz of the people , derived from þeudō, descended from protoindoeuropean tewtéh people, from which the word teutons also originates.

prehuman ancestors, the danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in germany over  million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs. ancient humans were present in germany at least , years ago. the first nonmodern human fossil  was discovered in the neander valley. similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the swabian jura, including ,yearold flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the ,yearold lion man, and the ,yearold venus of hohle fels. the nebra sky disk, created during the european bronze age, has been attributed to a german site.

the germanic peoples are thought to date from the nordic bronze age, early iron age, or the jastorf culture. from southern scandinavia and northern germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the celtic, iranian, baltic, and slavic tribes.under augustus, the roman empire began to invade lands inhabited by the germanic tribes, creating a shortlived roman province of germania between the rhine and elbe rivers. in  ad, three roman legions were defeated by arminius in the battle of the teutoburg forest. the outcome of this battle dissuaded the romans from their ambition of conquering germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in european history. by  ad, when tacitus wrote germania, germanic tribes had settled along the rhine and the danube , occupying most of modern germany. however, badenwürttemberg, southern bavaria, southern hesse and the western rhineland had been incorporated into roman provinces.around , germanic peoples broke into romancontrolled lands. after the invasion of the huns in , and with the decline of rome from , germanic tribes moved farther southwest the franks established the frankish kingdom and pushed east to subjugate saxony and bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern germany were inhabited by western slavic tribes.

charlemagne founded the carolingian empire in ; it was divided in . the eastern successor kingdom of east francia stretched from the rhine in the west to the elbe river in the east and from the north sea to the alps. subsequently, the holy roman empire emerged from it. the ottonian rulers  consolidated several major duchies. in , gregory v became the first german pope, appointed by his cousin otto iii, whom he shortly after crowned holy roman emperor. the holy roman empire absorbed northern italy and burgundy under the salian emperors , although the emperors lost power through the investiture controversy.under the hohenstaufen emperors , german princes encouraged german settlement to the south and east . members of the hanseatic league, mostly north german towns, prospered in the expansion of trade. the population declined starting with the great famine in , followed by the black death of . the golden bull issued in  provided the constitutional structure of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven princeelectors.johannes gutenberg introduced moveabletype printing to europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge. in , martin luther incited the protestant reformation and his translation of the bible began the standardization of the language; the  peace of augsburg tolerated the evangelical faith , but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects . from the cologne war through the thirty years wars , religious conflict devastated german lands and significantly reduced the population.the peace of westphalia ended religious warfare among the imperial estates; their mostly germanspeaking rulers were able to choose catholicism, lutheranism, or calvinism as their official religion. the legal system initiated by a series of imperial reforms  provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger imperial diet. the house of habsburg held the imperial crown from  until the death of charles vi in . following the war of the austrian succession and the treaty of aixlachapelle, charles vis daughter maria theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, francis i, became emperor.from , dualism between the austrian habsburg monarchy and the kingdom of prussia dominated german history. in , , and , prussia and austria, along with the russian empire, agreed to the partitions of poland. during the period of the french revolutionary wars, the napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the imperial diet, most of the free imperial cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. in  the imperium was dissolved; france, russia, prussia, and the habsburgs  competed for hegemony in the german states during the napoleonic wars.

following the fall of napoleon, the congress of vienna founded the german confederation, a loose league of  sovereign states. the appointment of the emperor of austria as the permanent president reflected the congresss rejection of prussias rising influence. disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by austrian statesman klemens von metternich. the zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity. in light of revolutionary movements in europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of  in the german states, raising the german question. king frederick william iv of prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.king william i appointed otto von bismarck as the minister president of prussia in . bismarck successfully concluded the war with denmark in ; the subsequent decisive prussian victory in the austroprussian war of  enabled him to create the north german confederation which excluded austria. after the defeat of france in the francoprussian war, the german princes proclaimed the founding of the german empire in . prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the king of prussia ruled as its kaiser, and berlin became its capital.in the gründerzeit period following the unification of germany, bismarcks foreign policy as chancellor of germany secured germanys position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war. however, under wilhelm ii, germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. a dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of austriahungary; the triple alliance of  included italy. britain, france and russia also concluded alliances to protect against habsburg interference with russian interests in the balkans or german interference against france. at the berlin conference in , germany claimed several colonies including german east africa, german south west africa, togoland, and kamerun. later, germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the pacific and china. the colonial government in south west africa , from  to , carried out the annihilation of the local herero and namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising; this was the th centurys first genocide.the assassination of austrias crown prince on  june  provided the pretext for austriahungary to attack serbia and trigger world war i. after four years of warfare, in which approximately two million german soldiers were killed, a general armistice ended the fighting. in the german revolution , emperor wilhelm ii and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and germany was declared a federal republic. germanys new leadership signed the treaty of versailles in , accepting defeat by the allies. germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of adolf hitler. germany lost around  of its european territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in africa and the pacific.

on  august , president friedrich ebert signed the democratic weimar constitution. in the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the republic in the kapp putsch. street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the ruhr by belgian and french troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in  ushered in the golden twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.the worldwide great depression hit germany in . chancellor heinrich brünings government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly  by . the nazi party led by adolf hitler became the largest party in the reichstag after a special election in  and hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor of germany on  january . after the reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first nazi concentration camp opened. on  march , the enabling act gave hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution, and marked the beginning of nazi germany. his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the league of nations, and dramatically increased the countrys rearmament. a governmentsponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the autobahn.in , the regime withdrew from the treaty of versailles and introduced the nuremberg laws which targeted jews and other minorities. germany also reacquired control of the saarland in , remilitarised the rhineland in , annexed austria in , annexed the sudetenland in  with the munich agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied czechoslovakia in march . kristallnacht  saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of jewish businesses, and mass arrests of jewish people.in august , hitlers government negotiated the molotovribbentrop pact that divided eastern europe into german and soviet spheres of influence. on  september , germany invaded poland, beginning world war ii in europe; britain and france declared war on germany on  september. in the spring of , germany conquered denmark and norway, the netherlands, belgium, luxembourg, and france, forcing the french government to sign an armistice. the british repelled german air attacks in the battle of britain in the same year. in , german troops invaded yugoslavia, greece and the soviet union. by , germany and its allies controlled most of continental europe and north africa, but following the soviet victory at the battle of stalingrad, the allied reconquest of north africa and invasion of italy in , german forces suffered repeated military defeats. in , the soviets pushed into eastern europe; the western allies landed in france and entered germany despite a final german counteroffensive. following hitlers suicide during the battle of berlin, germany signed the surrender document on  may , ending world war ii in europe and nazi germany. following the end of the war, surviving nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the nuremberg trials.in what later became known as the holocaust, the german government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across europe. in total  million people were systematically murdered, including  million jews, at least , romani, , disabled people, thousands of jehovahs witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents. nazi policies in germanoccupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated . million poles, . million ukrainians,  million belarusians and . million soviet prisoners of war. german military casualties have been estimated at . million, and around , german civilians died. around  million ethnic germans were expelled from across eastern europe, and germany lost roughly onequarter of its prewar territory.

after nazi germany surrendered, the allies de jure abolished german state and partitioned berlin and germanys remaining territory into four occupation zones. the western sectors, controlled by france, the united kingdom, and the united states, were merged on  may  to form the federal republic of germany ; on  october , the soviet zone became the german democratic republic  . they were informally known as west germany and east germany. east germany selected east berlin as its capital, while west germany chose bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the twostate solution was temporary.west germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a social market economy. starting in  west germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the american marshall plan. konrad adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of germany in . the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth  beginning in the early s. west germany joined nato in  and was a founding member of the european economic community. on  january , the saarland joined west germany.east germany was an eastern bloc state under political and military control by the soviet union via occupation forces and the warsaw pact. although east germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members  of the communistcontrolled socialist unity party of germany, supported by the stasi, an immense secret service. while east german propaganda was based on the benefits of the gdrs social programmes and the alleged threat of a west german invasion, many of its citizens looked to the west for freedom and prosperity. the berlin wall, built in , prevented east german citizens from escaping to west germany, becoming a symbol of the cold war.tensions between east and west germany were reduced in the late s by chancellor willy brandts ostpolitik. in , hungary decided to dismantle the iron curtain and open its border with austria, causing the emigration of thousands of east germans to west germany via hungary and austria. this had devastating effects on the gdr, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. in an effort to help retain east germany as a state, the east german authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the wende reform process culminating in the two plus four treaty under which germany regained full sovereignty. this permitted german reunification on  october , with the accession of the five reestablished states of the former gdr. the fall of the wall in  became a symbol of the fall of communism, the dissolution of the soviet union, german reunification and die wende .

united germany was considered the enlarged continuation of west germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations. based on the berlin/bonn act , berlin again became the capital of germany, while bonn obtained the unique status of a bundesstadt  retaining some federal ministries. the relocation of the government was completed in , and modernisation of the east german economy was scheduled to last until .since reunification, germany has taken a more active role in the european union, signing the maastricht treaty in  and the lisbon treaty in , and cofounding the eurozone. germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the balkans and sent german troops to afghanistan as part of a nato effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the taliban.in the  elections, angela merkel became the first female chancellor. in , the german government approved a  billion stimulus plan. among the major german political projects of the early st century are the advancement of european integration, the energy transition  for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate , and hightech strategies for the transition of the german economy, summarised as industry .. during the  european migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.

lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from edison technical school on capitol hill in seattle.in march , lee enrolled at the university of washington and studied dramatic arts, philosophy, psychology, and various other subjects. despite what lee himself and many others have stated, lees official major was drama rather than philosophy, according to a  article in the universitys alumni publication.lee dropped out of university in early  and moved to oakland to live with james yimm lee. james lee was twenty years senior to bruce lee and a wellknown chinese martial artist in the area. together, they founded the second jun fan martial arts studio in oakland. james lee was responsible for introducing bruce lee to ed parker, an american martial artist. at the invitation of parker, lee appeared in the  long beach international karate championships and performed repetitions of twofinger pushups, using the thumb and the index finger of one hand, with feet at approximately shoulderwidth apart.in the same long beach event he also performed the one inch punch. lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. lees right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately one inch  away from the partners chest. without retracting his right arm, lee then forcibly delivered the punch to volunteer bob baker while largely maintaining his posture. this sent baker backwards and falling into a chair placed behind baker to prevent injury, though bakers momentum caused him to fall to the floor. baker recalled, i told bruce not to do this type of demonstration again. when he punched me that last time, i had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable. it was at the  championships that lee first met taekwondo master jhoon goo rhee. the two developed a friendshipa relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. rhee taught lee the side kick in detail, and lee taught rhee the nontelegraphic punch.in oaklands chinatown in , lee had a controversial private match with wong jackman, a direct student of ma kin fung, known for his mastery of xingyiquan, northern shaolin, and tai chi. according to lee, the chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching nonchinese people. when he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with wong. the arrangement was that if lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else.wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight lee after lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in san francisco, and that wong himself did not discriminate against whites or other nonchinese people. lee commented, that paper had all the names of the sifu from chinatown, but they dont scare me. individuals known to have witnessed the match include cadwell, james lee , and william chen, a teacher of tai chi.

wong and william chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long  minutes. wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, lee aggressively attacked him with intent to kill. when wong presented the traditional handshake, lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at wongs eyes. forced to defend his life, wong asserted that he refrained from striking lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence, but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves. according to michael dorgans  book bruce lees toughest fight, the fight ended due to lees unusually winded condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.however, according to bruce lee, linda lee cadwell, and james yimm lee, the fight lasted a mere three minutes with a decisive victory for lee. in cadwells account, the fight ensued, it was a noholdsbarred fight, it took three minutes. bruce got this guy down to the ground and said do you give up and the man said he gave up. a couple of weeks after the bout, lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which wong says was an obvious reference to him.in response, wong published his own account of the fight in the pacific weekly, a chineselanguage newspaper in san francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if lee was not satisfied with the account. lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation. there were no further public announcements by either, though lee continued to teach white people. lee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. however, a martial arts exhibition on long beach in  eventually led to the invitation by television producer william dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for number one son about lee chan, the son of charlie chan. the show never materialised, but dozier saw potential in lee.

from  to , lee played the role of kato alongside the title character played by van williams in the tv series produced and narrated by william dozier titled the green hornet, based on the radio show by the same name. the show ran for one season  from september  to march . lee and williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of batman, another william dozierproduced television series.the green hornet introduced the adult bruce lee to an american audience, and became the first popular american show presenting asianstyle martial arts. the shows director wanted lee to fight in the typical american style using fists and punches. as a professional martial artist, lee refused, insisting that he should fight in the style of his expertise. at first, lee moved so fast that his movements could not be caught on film, so he had to slow them down.during the shows production, lee became friends with gene lebell, who worked as a stuntman in the show. the two trained together and exchange martial arts knowledge from their respective specialties. after the show was cancelled in , lee wrote to dozier thanking him for starting my career in show business.in , lee played a role in one episode of ironside.

jeet kune do originated in . after filming one season of the green hornet, lee found himself out of work and opened the jun fan gung fu institute. the controversial match with wong jackman influenced lees philosophy about martial arts. lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his wing chun techniques. he took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalised to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency. he started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.lee emphasised what he called the style of no style. this consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. lee felt that even the system he now called jun fan gung fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call jeet kune do or the way of the intercepting fist. it is a term he would later regret, because jeet kune do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.at the time, two of lees martial arts students were hollywood script writer stirling silliphant and actor james coburn. in , the three worked on a script for a film titled the silent flute, and they went together on a location hunt to india. the project was not realised at the time, but the  film circle of iron, starring david carradine, was based on the same plot. in , producer paul maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for the silent flute.in , lee made a brief appearance in the silliphantpenned film marlowe, where he played a hoodlum hired to intimidate private detective philip marlowe, played by james garner, who uses his martial arts abilities to commit acts of vandalisation to intimidate marlowe. the same year, he was credited as the karate advisor in the wrecking crew, the fourth instalment of the matt helm comedy spyfi film starring dean martin. also that year, lee acted in one episode of here come the brides and blondie.in , lee was responsible for producing the fight choreography of a walk in the spring rain, starring ingrid bergman and anthony quinn, again written by silliphant.

in , lee appeared in four episodes of the television series longstreet, written by silliphant. lee played li tsung, the martial arts instructor of the title character mike longstreet, played by james franciscus, and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script. according to statements made by lee, and also by linda lee cadwell after lees death, in  lee pitched a television series of his own, tentatively titled the warrior, discussions of which were confirmed by warner bros. during a december , , television interview on the pierre berton show, lee stated that both paramount and warner brothers wanted him to be in a modernized type of a thing, and that they think the western idea is out, whereas i want to do the western.according to cadwell, lees concept was retooled and renamed kung fu, but warner bros. gave lee no credit. warner brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers and producers, ed spielman and howard friedlander in , as stated too by lees biographer matthew polly. according to these sources, the reason lee was not cast was because he had a thick accent, but fred weintraub attributes that to his ethnicity.the role of the shaolin monk in the wild west was eventually awarded to thennonmartialartist david carradine. in an interview with the pierre berton show, lee stated he understood warner brothers attitudes towards casting in the series they think that businesswise it is a risk. i dont blame them. if the situation were reversed, and an american star were to come to hong kong, and i was the man with the money, i would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there.producer fred weintraub had advised lee to return to hong kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in hollywood. not happy with his supporting roles in the us, lee returned to hong kong. unaware that the green hornet had been played to success in hong kong and was unofficially referred to as the kato show, he was surprised to be recognised as the star of the show. after negotiating with both shaw brothers studio and golden harvest, lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by golden harvest.

lee played his first leading role in the big boss , which proved to be an enormous box office success across asia and catapulted him to stardom. he followed up with fist of fury , which broke the box office records set previously by the big boss. having finished his initial twoyear contract, lee negotiated a new deal with golden harvest. lee later formed his own company, concord production inc., with chow. for his third film, the way of the dragon , he was given complete control of the films production as the writer, director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. in , at a demonstration in long beach, california, lee met karate champion chuck norris. in the way of the dragon lee introduced norris to moviegoers as his opponent. their showdown has been characterised as one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history. the role had originally been offered to american karate champion joe lewis. fist of fury and way of the dragon grossed an estimated us million and us million worldwide, respectively.from august to october , lee began work on his fourth golden harvest film, game of death. he began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with  ft  in  american basketball star kareem abduljabbar, a former student. production stopped in november  when warner brothers offered lee the opportunity to star in enter the dragon, the first film to be produced jointly by concord, golden harvest, and warner bros. filming began in hong kong in february  and was completed in april .one month into the filming, another production company, starseas motion pictures, promoted bruce lee as a leading actor in fist of unicorn, although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his longtime friend unicorn chan. lee planned to sue the production company, but retained his friendship with chan. however, only a few months after the completion of enter the dragon, and six days before its july , , release, lee died.enter the dragon went on to become one of the years highestgrossing films and cemented lee as a martial arts legend. it was made for us, in , the equivalent to  million adjusted for inflation as of . enter the dragon is estimated to have grossed over  million worldwide, the equivalent of over  billion adjusted for inflation as of . the film sparked a brief fad in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as kung fu fighting and some tv shows.

robert clouse, the director of enter the dragon, together with golden harvest, revived lees unfinished film game of death. lee had shot over  minutes of footage, including outtakes, for game of death before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on enter the dragon. in addition to abduljabbar, george lazenby, hapkido master ji hanjae, and another of lees students, dan inosanto, appeared in the film, which culminated in lees character, hai tien, clad in the nowfamous yellow track suit taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a fivelevel pagoda.in a controversial move, robert clouse finished the film using a lookalike and archive footage of lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, which was released in . however, the cobbledtogether film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of lee  while the rest had a lee lookalike, kim tai chung, and yuen biao as stunt double. the unused footage lee had filmed was recovered  years later and included in the documentary bruce lee a warriors journey.

apart from game of death, other future film projects were planned to feature lee at the time. in , after the success of the big boss and fist of fury, a third film was planned by raymond chow at golden harvest to be directed by lo wei, titled yellowfaced tiger. however, at the time, lee decided to direct and produce his own script for way of the dragon instead. although lee had formed a production company with raymond chow, a period film was also planned from septembernovember  with the competing shaw brothers studio, to be directed by either chor yuen or cheng kang, and written by yi kang and chang cheh, titled the seven sons of the jade dragon.in , perfect storm entertainment and bruce lees daughter, shannon lee, announced that the series the warrior would be produced and would air on the cinemax. filmmaker justin lin was chosen to direct the series. production began in october , in cape town, south africa. the first season will contain  episodes. in april , cinemax renewed the series for a second season.in march , it was announced that producer jason kothari had acquired the rights to the silent flute to become a miniseries, which would have john fusco as a screenwriter and executive producer.

lee had also worked on several scripts himself. a tape containing a recording of lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled southern fist/northern leg exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for the silent flute . another script had the title green bamboo warrior, set in san francisco, planned to costar bolo yeung and to be produced by andrew vajna. photoshoot costume tests were organised for some of these planned film projects.

lees first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of wustyle tai chi. in his teens, lee became involved in hong kong gang conflicts, which led to frequent street fights. the largest influence on lees martial arts development was his study of wing chun. lee was  years old under the wing chun teacher yip man, between late  and , after losing to rival gang members.yips regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, chi sao  drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free sparring. there was no set pattern to the classes. other chinese martial arts styles lee trained in were northern praying mantis, southern praying mantis, eagle claw, tan tui, law hon, mizongyi, wa kung, monkey, southern dragon, fujian white crane, choy li fut, hung gar, choy gar, fut gar, mok gar, yau kung moon, li gar, and lau gar.lee was trained in boxing, between  and , by brother edward, coach of the st. francis xaviers college boxing team. lee went on to win the hong kong schools boxing tournament in , while scoring knockdowns against the previous champion gary elms in the final. after moving to the united states, lee was heavily influenced by heavyweight boxing champion muhammad ali, whose footwork he studied and incorporated into his own style in the s.lee demonstrated his jeet kune do martial arts at the long beach international karate championships in  and , with the latter having higherquality video footage available. lee is seen demonstrating quick eye strikes before his opponent can block, and demonstrating the oneinch punch on several volunteers. he demonstrates chi sao drills while blindfolded against an opponent, probing for weaknesses in his opponent while scoring with punches and takedowns. lee then participates in a fullcontact sparring bout against an opponent, with both wearing leather headgear.lee is seen implementing his jeet kune do concept of economical motion, using aliinspired footwork to keep out of range while counterattacking with backfists and straight punches. he halts attacks with stophit side kicks, and quickly executes several sweeps and head kicks. the opponent repeatedly attempts to attack lee, but is never able to connect with a clean hit. he once manages to come close with a spin kick, but lee counters it. the footage was reviewed by black belt magazine in , concluding that the action is as fast and furious as anything in lees films.it was at the  championships that lee first met taekwondo master jhoon goo rhee. while rhee taught lee the side kick in detail, lee taught rhee the nontelegraphic punch. rhee learned what he calls the accupunch from lee and incorporated it into american taekwondo. the accupunch is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block, based on human reaction timethe idea is to finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the braintowrist communication.lee commonly used the oblique kick, made popular much later in mixed martial arts. it is called the jeet tek, stop kick or intercepting kick, in jeet kune do.

lee favored crosstraining between different fighting styles, and had a particular interest in grappling. lee trained with several judo practitioners in seattle and california, among them fred sato, jesse glover, taky kimura, hayward nishioka and wally jay, as well as gene lebell. many of his first students were proficient in judo and other arts, and he learned as much as he taught. after befriending lebell on the set of the green hornet, lee offered to teach him striking arts in exchange for being taught grappling techniques. lebell had been taught catch wrestling by prestigious grapplers lou thesz and ed lewis, and notable techniques of both judo and catch wrestling can be seen in lees tao of jeet kune do. he also learned grappling moves from hapkido master ji hanjae.according to glover, lee only found judo ineffective at the action of getting hold of the opponent. in their first training together, glover showed lee an osoto gari, which lee considered not a bad technique, but he disliked that glover had needed to hold onto lee. while in seattle, lee developed antigrappling techniques against opponents trying to tackle him or take him to the ground. glover recalled lee definitely would not go to the ground if he had the opportunity to get you standing up. nonetheless, lee expressed to lebell a wish to integrate judo into his fighting style. he incorporated the osoto gari into jeet kune do, among other throws, armlocks and chokeholds from judo.although lee opined that grappling was of little use in action choreography because it was not visually distinctive, he showcased grappling moves in his own films, such as way of the dragon, where his character finishes his opponent chuck norris with a neck hold inspired by lebell, and enter the dragon, whose prologue features lee submitting his opponent sammo hung with an armbar. game of death also features lee and hanjae exchanging grappling moves, as well as lee using wrestling against the character played by kareem abduljabbar.lee was also influenced by the training routine of the great gama, an indian/pakistani pehlwani wrestling champion known for his grappling strength. lee incorporated gamas exercises into his own training routine.

another major influence on lee was hong kongs street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights. in the midth century, soaring crime in hong kong, combined with limited hong kong police manpower, led to many young hongkongers learning martial arts for selfdefence. around the s, there were about  martial arts schools in hong kong, teaching their own distinctive styles of martial arts. in hong kongs street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the s and s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bareknuckle fights on hong kongs rooftops, in order to avoid crackdowns by british colonial authorities. lee frequently participated in these hong kong rooftop fights. he combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts style.when lee returned to hong kong in the early s, his reputation as the fastest fist in the east routinely led to locals challenging him to street fights. he sometimes accepted these challenges and engaged in street fights, which led to some criticism from the press portraying him as violent at the time.

at  cm  and weighing  kg , lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. after his match with wong jackman in , lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. lee included all elements of total fitnessmuscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. he used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. at the same time, with respect to balance, lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. in tao of jeet kune do he wrote

training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation. ... jkd, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.

according to linda lee cadwell, soon after he moved to the united states, lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, highprotein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. he later concluded that achieving a highperformance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a highperformance automobile. allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on lowoctane fuels, one could not sustain ones body with a steady diet of junk food, and with the wrong fuel, ones body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.lee avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body. he was known for being a fan of asian cuisine for its variety, and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish. lee had a dislike for dairy products and as a result, used powdered milk in his diet.dan inosanto recalls lee practised meditation as the first action on his schedule.

while best known as a martial artist, lee studied drama and asian and western philosophy, starting while a student at the university of washington. he was wellread and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. his own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. his eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to say that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings.he believed that any knowledge ultimately led to selfknowledge. he said that his chosen method of selfexpression was martial arts. his influences include taoism, jiddu krishnamurti, and buddhism. lees philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by confucianism. john little states that lee was an atheist. when asked in  about his religious affiliation, he replied, none whatsoever. when asked if he believed in god, he said, to be perfectly frank, i really do not.

aside from martial arts and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and selfconsciousness for truths and principles, lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively. many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. lees principle of selfexpression was applied to his poetry as well. his daughter shannon lee said, he did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist.his poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with john little being the major author , for bruce lees works. linda lee cadwell  shared her husbands notes, poems, and experiences with followers. she mentioned lees poems are, by american standards, rather darkreflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche.most of bruce lees poems are categorised as antipoetry or fall into a paradox. the mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as robert frost, one of many wellknown poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. the paradox taken from the yin and yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. his martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. the free verse form of lees poetry reflects his famous quote be formless ... shapeless, like water.

lees cantonese birth name was lee junfan . the name homophonically means return again, and was given to lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the united states once he came of age. because of his mothers superstitious nature, she had originally named him saifon , which is a feminine name meaning small phoenix. the english name bruce is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician, dr. mary glover.lee had three other chinese names lee yuencham , a family/clan name; lee yuenkam , which he used as a student name while he was attending la salle college, and his chinese screen name lee siulung . lees given name junfan was originally written in chinese as 震藩; however, the jun  chinese character was identical to part of his grandfathers name, lee junbiu . hence, the chinese character for jun in lees name was changed to the homonym 振 instead, to avoid naming taboo in chinese tradition.

lees father, lee hoichuen, was one of the leading cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a yearlong opera tour with his family on the eve of the japanese invasion of hong kong. lee hoichuen had been touring the united states for many years and performing in numerous chinese communities there.

although many of his peers decided to stay in the us, lee hoichuen returned to hong kong after bruces birth. within months, hong kong was invaded and the lees lived for three years and eight months under japanese occupation. after the war ended, lee hoichuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during hong kongs rebuilding years.

lees mother, grace ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in hong kong, the hotungs. she was the halfniece of sir robert hotung, the eurasian patriarch of the clan. as such, the young bruce lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. despite the advantage of his familys status, the neighbourhood in which lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist china for hong kong, at that time a british crown colony.grace ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of ho komtong  and the halfniece of sir robert hotung, both notable hong kong businessmen and philanthropists. bruce was the fourth of five children phoebe lee , agnes lee , peter lee, and robert lee.

graces parentage remains unclear. linda lee, in her  biography the bruce lee story, suggests that grace had a german father and was a catholic. bruce thomas, in his influential  biography bruce lee fighting spirit, suggests that grace had a chinese mother and a german father. lees relative eric peter ho, in his  book tracing my childrens lineage, suggests that grace was born in shanghai to a eurasian woman named cheung kingsin. eric peter ho said that grace lee was the daughter of a mixed race shanghainese woman and her father was ho kom tong. grace lee said her mother was english and her father was chinese. fredda dudley balling said grace lee was threequarters chinese and onequarter british.in the  biography bruce lee a life, matthew polly identifies lees maternal grandfather as ho komtong, who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather. ho komtongs father, charles maurice bosman, was a dutch jewish businessman from rotterdam. he moved to hong kong with the dutch east india company and served as the dutch consul to hong kong at one time. he had a chinese concubine named sze tai with whom he had six children, including ho kom tong. bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to california. ho kom tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife,  concubines, and a british mistress who gave birth to grace ho.his younger brother robert lee junfai is a musician and singer; his group the thunderbirds was famous in hong kong. a few singles were sung mostly or all in english. also released was lee singing a duet with irene ryder. lee junfai lived with lee in los angeles in the united states and stayed. after lees death, lee junfai released an album and the single by the same name dedicated to lee called the ballad of bruce lee.while studying at the university of washington he met his future wife linda emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher. as relations between people of different races was still banned in many us states, they married in secret in august . lee had two children with linda brandon  and shannon lee . upons lee passing in , she continued to promote bruce lees martial art jeet kune do. she wrote the  book bruce lee the man only i knew, on which the  feature film dragon the bruce lee story was based. in , she wrote the book the bruce lee story. she retired in  from the family estate.

israel , officially the state of israel , is a country in west asia. it is bordered by lebanon to the north, by syria to the northeast, by jordan to the east, by the red sea to the south, by egypt to the southwest, by the mediterranean sea to the west, and by the palestinian territories   the west bank along the east and the gaza strip along the southwest. tel aviv is the financial, economic, and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of jerusalem, although israeli sovereignty over both  west and east jerusalem is unrecognized internationally.israel is located in the southern levant, a region known historically as canaan, the land of israel, palestine and the holy land. in antiquity, it was home to several israelite and jewish kingdoms, including israel and judah and hasmonean judea. over the ages, the region was ruled by imperial powers such as the assyrians, babylonians, persians, greeks, and romans. during roman rule, jews became a minority in palestine. the region later came under byzantine and arab rule. in the medieval period, it was part of the islamic caliphates, the crusader kingdom of jerusalem, and the ottoman empire. the late th century saw the rise of zionism, a movement advocating for the establishment of a jewish homeland, during which the jewish people began purchasing land in palestine. under the british mandate by the league of nations after world war i, jewish immigration to the region increased considerably, leading to tensions between jews and the arab majority population. the unapproved  partition plan triggered a civil war between these two peoples. the british terminated the mandate on  may , and israel declared independence on the same day.

on  may , the armies of five neighboring arab states began entering the area of the former mandatory palestine, starting the first arabisraeli war. an armistice in  left israel in control of more territory than the u.n. partition plan had called for; and no new independent arab state was created as the rest of the former mandate territory were held by egypt and jordan, respectively the gaza strip and the west bank. the conflict resulted in the expulsion or flight of over , palestinian arabs from israeli territory to neighboring countries, leaving fewer than , within the green line. the number of jews who emigrated, fled, or were expelled from the arab world to israel was around , during and immediately after the war, reaching approximately , over the subsequent two decades. the  sixday war resulted in the israeli occupation of the palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza strip, along with the egyptian sinai peninsula and the syrian golan heights. israel has since effectively annexed both east jerusalem and the golan heights, and has established settlements across the occupied territories, actions which were rejected as illegal under international law. since the  yom kippur war, israel has signed peace treaties with egypt, returning the sinai peninsula, and with jordan, and more recently normalized relations with several arab countries, though efforts to resolve the israelipalestinian conflict have not succeeded. israels practices, in the longest military occupation in modern history, have drawn international condemnation for violating the human rights of the palestinians.the country has a parliamentary system elected by means of proportional representation. the prime minister serves as head of government, and is elected by the knesset, israels unicameral legislature. israel is the most developed country in the middle east, and an oecd member. it has the highest standards of living in the middle east, and is one of the most advanced and technological countries, with a population of nearly  million people, as of . it has the worlds thlargest economy by nominal gdp and th by nominal gdp per capita.

under the british mandate , the whole region was known as palestine. upon independence in , the country formally adopted the name state of israel  after other proposed historical and religious names including land of israel , ever , zion, and judea, were considered but rejected, while the name israel was suggested by bengurion and passed by a vote of . in the early weeks of independence, the government chose the term israeli to denote a citizen of israel, with the formal announcement made by minister of foreign affairs moshe sharett.the names land of israel and children of israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical kingdom of israel and the entire jewish people respectively. the name israel  in these phrases refers to the patriarch jacob who, according to the hebrew bible, was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the lord. jacobs twelve sons became the ancestors of the israelites, also known as the twelve tribes of israel or children of israel. jacob and his sons had lived in canaan but were forced by famine to go into egypt for four generations, lasting  years, until moses, a greatgreatgrandson of jacob, led the israelites back into canaan during the exodus. the earliest known archaeological artefact to mention the word israel as a collective is the merneptah stele of ancient egypt .

early expansions of hominins out of africa into the prehistoric levant, where israel is located, dates back at least . million years ago based on traces found at ubeidiya in the jordan rift valley, while the skhul and qafzeh hominins, homo sapiens fossils dating back , years, are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of africa. the natufian culture emerged in the southern levant by the th millennium bce, followed by the ghassulian culture by around , bce.

the canaanites are archaeologically attested in the middle bronze age . during the late bronze age , large parts of canaan formed vassal states paying tribute to the new kingdom of egypt. as a result of the late bronze age collapse, canaan fell into chaos, and egyptian control over the region collapsed completely. there is evidence that urban centers such as hazor, beit shean, megiddo, ekron, ashdod, and ashkelon were damaged or destroyed.a people named israel appear for the first time in the merneptah stele, an ancient egyptian inscription which dates to about  bce. ancestors of the israelites are thought to have included ancient semiticspeaking peoples native to this area. according to the modern archaeological account, the israelites and their culture branched out of the canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristicand later monotheisticreligion centered on yahweh. they spoke an archaic form of the hebrew language, known as biblical hebrew. around the same time, the philistines settled on the southern coastal plain.modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the torah concerning the patriarchs, the exodus and the tales of conquest described in the book of joshua, and instead views the narrative as constituting the israelites national myth. however, some elements of these traditions do appear to have historical roots.

there is debate about the earliest existence of the kingdoms of israel and judah and their extent and power. while it is unclear if there was ever a united kingdom of israel, historians and archaeologists agree that the northern kingdom of israel existed by ca.  bce and that the kingdom of judah existed by ca.  bce. the kingdom of israel was the more prosperous of the two kingdoms and soon developed into a regional power; during the days of the omride dynasty, it controlled samaria, galilee, the upper jordan valley, the sharon and large parts of the transjordan. samaria, the capital, was home to one of the largest iron age structures in the levant.the kingdom of israel was destroyed around  bce, when it was conquered by the neoassyrian empire. the kingdom of judah, with its capital in jerusalem, later became a client state of first the neoassyrian empire and then the neobabylonian empire. it is estimated that the regions population was around , in the iron age ii. in / bce, following a revolt in judah, king nebuchadnezzar ii besieged and destroyed jerusalem and solomons temple, dissolved the kingdom and exiled much of the judean elite to babylon, beginning the babylonian captivity. the defeat was also recorded in the babylonian chronicles. after capturing babylon in  bce, cyrus the great, founder of the persian achaemenid empire, issued a proclamation allowing the exiled judean population to return to judah. the returned jewish population was permitted to selfgovern and rebuild the temple.

the construction of the second temple was completed c. bce. the persians ruled the region as the province of yehud, which had a population of around , people in the th to th centuries bce.in  bce, alexander the great of macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the persian empire. after his death, the area was controlled by the ptolemaic and seleucid empires as a part of coelesyria. over the ensuing centuries, the hellenization of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of antiochus iv, giving rise to the maccabean revolt of  bce. the civil unrest weakened seleucid rule and in the late nd century the semiautonomous hasmonean kingdom of judea arose, eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions.

the roman republic invaded the region in  bce, first taking control of syria, and then intervening in the hasmonean civil war. the struggle between proroman and proparthian factions in judea led to the installation of herod the great as a dynastic vassal of rome. in  ce, the area was fully annexed as the roman province of judaea, a period that heralded tensions with roman rule, and led to a series of jewishroman wars, resulting in widespread destruction. the first jewishroman war  resulted in the destruction of jerusalem and the second temple and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.a second uprising known as the bar kokhba revolt took place during  ce. initial successes allowed the jews to form an independent state in judea, but the romans massed large forces and brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating judeas countryside. jerusalem was rebuilt as a roman colony under the name of aelia capitolina, and the province of judea was renamed syria palaestina. jews were expelled from the districts surrounding jerusalem, and joined communities in the diaspora. nevertheless, there was a continuous small jewish presence and galilee became its religious center. jewish communities also continued to reside in the southern hebron hills and on the coastal plain.

with the transition of roman rule into that of the byzantine empire under emperor constantine, early christianity displaced the more tolerant roman paganism as an external influence. with the conversion of constantine in the th century, the situation for the jewish majority in palestine became more difficult. a series of laws were passed that discriminated against jews and judaism, and jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities. many jews had emigrated to flourishing diaspora communities, while locally there was both christian immigration and local conversion. by the middle of the th century, there was a christian majority. towards the end of the th century, samaritan revolts erupted, continuing until the late th century and resulting in a large decrease in the samaritan population. after the sasanian conquest of jerusalem and the shortlived jewish revolt against heraclius in  ce, the byzantine empire reconsolidated control of the area in .in  ce, the rashidun caliphate conquered the levant. over the next six centuries, control of the region transferred between the umayyad, abbasid, fatimid caliphates, and subsequently the seljuks and ayyubid dynasties. the population of the area drastically decreased during the following several centuries, dropping from an estimated  million during roman and byzantine periods to about , by the early ottoman period. alongside this population decline, there was a steady process of arabization and islamization brought on by nonmuslim emigration, muslim immigration, and local conversion to islam. the end of the th century brought the crusades, papallysanctioned incursions of christian crusaders intent on wresting jerusalem and the holy land from muslim control and establishing crusader states. the ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before muslim rule was fully restored by the mamluk sultans of egypt in .

in , the region was conquered by the ottoman empire and proceeded to be ruled as a part of ottoman syria for the next four centuries. in , a druze revolt led to the destruction of safed and tiberias. in the late th century, local arab sheikh zahir alumar created a de facto independent emirate in the galilee. ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed, but after zahirs death the ottomans regained control of the area. in  governor jazzar pasha successfully repelled an assault on acre by troops of napoleon, prompting the french to abandon the syrian campaign. in , a revolt by palestinian arab peasants broke out against egyptian conscription and taxation policies under muhammad ali. although the revolt was suppressed, muhammad alis army retreated and ottoman rule was restored with british support in . shortly after, the tanzimat reforms were implemented across the ottoman empire.

since the existence of the earliest jewish diaspora, many jews have aspired to return to zion and the land of israel, though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute. although the jewish population shrank dramatically throughout the periods of roman, byzantine, crusader, and islamic rule, a jewish presence continued to survive in the region. the jewish population of palestine from the outset of ottoman rule to the beginning of the zionist movement, known as the old yishuv, comprised a minority of the predominantly muslim and christian population and fluctuated in size throughout the centuries. during the th century, jewish communities struck roots in the four holy citiesjerusalem, tiberias, hebron, and safedand in , rabbi yehuda hachasid led a group of , jews to jerusalem. in the second half of the th century, eastern european jews who were opponents of hasidism, known as the perushim, settled in palestine.

the first wave of modern jewish migration to ottomanruled palestine, known as the first aliyah, began in , as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe. although the zionist movement already existed in practice, austrohungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism, a movement that sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel, thus offering a solution to the socalled jewish question of the european states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time. in , herzl published der judenstaat , offering his vision of a future jewish state; the following year he presided over the first zionist congress in basel, switzerland. the second aliyah  began after the kishinev pogrom; some , jews settled in palestine, although nearly half of them left eventually. both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly orthodox jews, although the second aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement. though the immigrants of the second aliyah largely sought to create communal agricultural settlements, the period saw the establishment of tel aviv as the first planned jewish town in . this period also saw the emergence of jewish armed militias, the first being bargiora, a guard founded in . two years later, the larger hashomer organization was founded as its replacement.

in , during world war i, british foreign secretary arthur balfour sent the balfour declaration to lord rothschild, a leader of the british jewish community, that stated that britain intended for the creation of a jewish national home in palestine.in , the jewish legion, a group primarily of zionist volunteers, assisted in the british conquest of palestine. in , after the allies conquered the levant during world war i, the territory was divided between britain and france under the mandate system, and the britishadministered area which included modern day israel was named mandatory palestine. arab opposition to british rule and jewish immigration led to the  palestine riots and the formation of a jewish militia known as the haganah  as an outgrowth of hashomer, from which the irgun and lehi paramilitaries later split off. in , the league of nations granted britain the mandate for palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews, and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians. the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim, with jews accounting for about , and arab christians about . of the population.the third  and fourth aliyahs  brought an additional , jews to palestine. the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in s europe led to the fifth aliyah, with an influx of a quarter of a million jews. this was a major cause of the arab revolt of , which was launched as a reaction to continued jewish immigration and land purchases. the revolt, which also involved a significant amount of intercommunal fighting among the arabs, was suppressed by british security forces and zionist militias. several hundred british security personnel and jews were killed, while , arabs were killed , were wounded, and , were detained. an estimated ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population was killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. the british introduced restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine with the white paper of . with countries around the world turning away jewish refugees fleeing the holocaust, a clandestine movement known as aliyah bet was organized to bring jews to palestine. by the end of world war ii, the jewish population of palestine had increased to  of the total population.after world war ii, the uk found itself facing a jewish guerrilla campaign over jewish immigration restrictions, as well as continued conflict with the arab community over limit levels. the haganah joined irgun and lehi in an armed struggle against british rule. at the same time, hundreds of thousands of jewish holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in europe. the haganah attempted to bring these refugees to palestine in a programme called aliyah bet in which tens of thousands of jewish refugees attempted to enter palestine by ship. most of the ships were intercepted by the royal navy and the refugees rounded up and placed in detention camps in atlit and cyprus by the british.

on  july , irgun bombed the british administrative headquarters for palestine, which was housed in the southern wing of the king david hotel in jerusalem. a total of  people of various nationalities were killed and  were injured. the hotel was the site of the secretariat of the government of palestine and the headquarters of the british armed forces in mandatory palestine and transjordan. the attack initially had the approval of the haganah. it was conceived as a response to operation agatha  and was the deadliest directed at the british during the mandate era. the jewish insurgency continued throughout the rest of  and  despite concerted efforts by the british military and palestine police force to suppress it. british efforts to mediate a negotiated solution with jewish and arab representatives also failed as the jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a jewish state and suggested a partition of palestine into jewish and arab states, while the arabs were adamant that a jewish state in any part of palestine was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified palestine under arab rule. in february , the british referred the palestine issue to the newly formed united nations. on  may , the general assembly of the united nations resolved that the united nations special committee on palestine be created to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the assembly a report on the question of palestine. in the report of the committee dated  september  to the general assembly, the majority of the committee in chapter vi proposed a plan to replace the british mandate with an independent arab state, an independent jewish state, and the city of jerusalem ... the last to be under an international trusteeship system. meanwhile, the jewish insurgency continued and peaked in july , with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in the sergeants affair, in which the irgun took two british sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three irgun operatives. after the executions were carried out, the irgun killed the two british soldiers, hanged their bodies from trees, and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a british soldier. the incident caused widespread outrage in the uk.in september , the british cabinet decided that the mandate was no longer tenable and to evacuate palestine. according to colonial secretary arthur creech jones, four major factors led to the decision to evacuate palestine the inflexibility of jewish and arab negotiators who were unwilling to compromise on their core positions over the question of a jewish state in palestine, the economic pressure that stationing a large garrison in palestine to deal with the jewish insurgency, the possibility of a wider jewish rebellion, and the possibility of an arab rebellion put on a british economy already strained by world war ii, the deadly blow to british patience and pride caused by the hangings of the sergeants, and the mounting criticism the government faced in failing to find a new policy for palestine in place of the white paper of .on  november , the general assembly adopted resolution   recommending the adoption and implementation of the plan of partition with economic union. the plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the committee in the report of  september. the jewish agency, which was the recognized representative of the jewish community, accepted the plan, which assigned  of mandatory palestine to the jews. at the time, the jews were about a third of the population of palestine and owned around  of the land. arabs constituted the majority of palestines population and owned about  of the land, with the remainder held by the mandate authorities or foreign landowners. the arab league and arab higher committee of palestine rejected it, and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition. on  december , the arab higher committee proclaimed a threeday strike, and riots broke out in jerusalem. the situation spiraled into a civil war; just two weeks after the un vote, colonial secretary arthur creech jones announced that the british mandate would end on  may , at which point the british would evacuate. as arab militias and gangs attacked jewish areas, they were faced mainly by the haganah, as well as the smaller irgun and lehi. in april , the haganah moved onto the offensive. during this period , palestinian arabs fled or were expelled, due to a number of factors.

on  may , the day before the expiration of the british mandate, david bengurion, the head of the jewish agency, declared the establishment of a jewish state in eretzisrael, to be known as the state of israel. the only reference in the text of the declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term eretzisrael . the following day, the armies of four arab countriesegypt, syria, transjordan and iraqentered into parts of what had been british mandatory palestine, launching the  arabisraeli war; contingents from yemen, morocco, saudi arabia and sudan joined the war. the apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the jewish state at inception, and some arab leaders talked about driving the jews into the sea. according to benny morris, jews were worried that the invading arab armies held the intent to slaughter them. the arab league stated the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed.after a year of fighting, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders, known as the green line, were established. jordan annexed what became known as the west bank, including east jerusalem, and egypt occupied the gaza strip. the un estimated that more than , palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing israeli forces during the conflictwhat would become known in arabic as the nakba . some , remained and became arab citizens of israel.israel was admitted as a member of the un by majority vote on  may . an israelijordanian attempt at negotiating a peace agreement broke down after the british government, fearful of the egyptian reaction to such a treaty, expressed their opposition to the jordanian government. in the early years of the state, the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david bengurion dominated israeli politics.immigration to israel during the late s and early s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the nongovernment sponsored mossad lealiyah bet  which organized illegal and clandestine immigration. both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation, but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the middle east and eastern europe, where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult. mossad lealiyah bet was disbanded in . the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan. the immigrants came for differing reasons some held zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life in israel, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled.an influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim countries to israel during the first three years increased the number of jews from , to ,,. by , the population of israel had risen to two million. between  and , approximately ,, jewish refugees relocated to israel. some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot; by , over , people were living in these tent cities. jews of european background were often treated more favorably than jews from middle eastern and north african countrieshousing units reserved for the latter were often redesignated for the former, with the result that jews newly arrived from arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer. during this period, food, clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period. the need to solve the crisis led bengurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust.

during the s, israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, mainly from the egyptianoccupied gaza strip, leading to several israeli reprisal operations. in , the united kingdom and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal, which the egyptians had nationalized. the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping, together with the growing amount of fedayeen attacks against israels southern population, and recent arab grave and threatening statements, prompted israel to attack egypt. israel joined a secret alliance with the united kingdom and france and overran the sinai peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the un in return for guarantees of israeli shipping rights in the red sea via the straits of tiran and the canal. the war, known as the suez crisis, resulted in significant reduction of israeli border infiltration.

in the early s, israel captured nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in argentina and brought him to israel for trial. the trial had a major impact on public awareness of the holocaust. eichmann remains the only person executed in israel by conviction in an israeli civilian court. during the spring and summer of  israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the united states due to the israeli nuclear programme.since , arab countries, concerned over israeli plans to divert waters of the jordan river into the coastal plain, had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive israel of water resources, provoking tensions between israel on the one hand, and syria and lebanon on the other. arab nationalists led by egyptian president gamal abdel nasser refused to recognize israel and called for its destruction. by , israeliarab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between israeli and arab forces.

in may , egypt massed its army near the border with israel, expelled un peacekeepers, stationed in the sinai peninsula since , and blocked israels access to the red sea. other arab states mobilized their forces. israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and, on  june, launched a preemptive strike against egypt. jordan, syria and iraq responded and attacked israel. in a sixday war, israel captured and occupied the west bank from jordan, the gaza strip and sinai peninsula from egypt, and the golan heights from syria. jerusalems boundaries were enlarged, incorporating east jerusalem, and the  green line became the administrative boundary between israel and the occupied territories.following the  war and the three nos resolution of the arab league, israel faced attacks from the egyptians in the sinai peninsula during the  war of attrition, and from palestinian groups targeting israelis in the occupied territories, in israel proper, and around the world. most important among the various palestinian and arab groups was the palestinian liberation organization , established in , which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland. in the late s and early s, palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks against israeli and jewish targets around the world, including a massacre of israeli athletes at the  summer olympics in munich. the israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre, a bombing and a raid on the plo headquarters in lebanon.

on  october , as jews were observing yom kippur, the egyptian and syrian armies launched a surprise attack against israeli forces in the sinai peninsula and golan heights, that opened the yom kippur war. the war ended on  october with israel successfully repelling egyptian and syrian forces but having suffered over , soldiers killed in a war which collectively took , lives in about  days. an internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war, but public anger forced prime minister golda meir to resign. in july , an airliner was hijacked during its flight from israel to france by palestinian guerrillas and landed at entebbe international airport, uganda. israeli commandos carried out an operation in which  out of  israeli hostages were successfully rescued.

the  knesset elections marked a major turning point in israeli political history as menachem begins likud party took control from the labor party. later that year, egyptian president anwar el sadat made a trip to israel and spoke before the knesset in what was the first recognition of israel by an arab head of state. in the two years that followed, sadat and begin signed the camp david accords  and the egyptisrael peace treaty . in return, israel withdrew from the sinai peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip.on  march , a plo guerilla raid from lebanon led to the coastal road massacre. israel responded by launching an invasion of southern lebanon to destroy the plo bases south of the litani river. most plo fighters withdrew, but israel was able to secure southern lebanon until a un force and the lebanese army could take over. the plo soon resumed its policy of attacks against israel. in the next few years, the plo infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground.

meanwhile, begins government provided incentives for israelis to settle in the occupied west bank, increasing friction with the palestinians in that area. the basic law jerusalem, capital of israel, passed in , was believed by some to reaffirm israels  annexation of jerusalem by government decree, and reignited international controversy over the status of the city. no israeli legislation has defined the territory of israel and no act specifically included east jerusalem therein. in  israel effectively annexed the golan heights, although annexation was not recognized internationally. the international community largely rejected these moves, with the un security council declaring both the jerusalem law and the golan heights law null and void. israels population diversity expanded in the s and s. several waves of ethiopian jews immigrated to israel since the s, while between  and , immigration from the postsoviet states increased israels population by twelve percent.on  june , during the iraniraq war, the israeli air force destroyed iraqs sole nuclear reactor under construction just outside baghdad, in order to impede iraqs nuclear weapons programme. following a series of plo attacks in , israel invaded lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the plo launched attacks and missiles into northern israel. in the first six days of fighting, the israelis destroyed the military forces of the plo in lebanon and decisively defeated the syrians. an israeli government inquirythe kahan commissionwould later hold begin and several israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the sabra and shatila massacre and hold defense minister ariel sharon as bearing personal responsibility for the massacre. sharon was forced to resign as defense minister. in , israel responded to a palestinian terrorist attack in cyprus by bombing the plo headquarters in tunisia. israel withdrew from most of lebanon in , but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern lebanon until , from where israeli forces engaged in conflict with hezbollah. the first intifada, a palestinian uprising against israeli rule, broke out in , with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied west bank and gaza. over the following six years, the intifada became more organized and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the israeli occupation. more than a thousand people were killed in the violence. during the  gulf war, the plo supported saddam hussein and iraqi scud missile attacks against israel. despite public outrage, israel heeded american calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war.

in , yitzhak rabin became prime minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with israels neighbours. the following year, shimon peres on behalf of israel, and mahmoud abbas for the plo, signed the oslo accords, which gave the palestinian national authority the right to govern parts of the west bank and the gaza strip. the plo also recognized israels right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism. in , the israeljordan peace treaty was signed, making jordan the second arab country to normalize relations with israel. arab public support for the accords was damaged by the continuation of israeli settlements and checkpoints, and the deterioration of economic conditions. israeli public support for the accords waned as israel was struck by palestinian suicide attacks. in november , yitzhak rabin was assassinated as he left a peace rally by yigal amir, a farright jew who opposed the accords.during benjamin netanyahus premiership at the end of the s, israel agreed to withdraw from hebron, though this was never ratified or implemented, and signed the wye river memorandum, giving greater control to the palestinian national authority. ehud barak, elected prime minister in , began the new millennium by withdrawing forces from southern lebanon and conducting negotiations with palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat and u.s. president bill clinton at the  camp david summit. during the summit, barak offered a plan for the establishment of a palestinian state. the proposed state included the entirety of the gaza strip and over  of the west bank with jerusalem as a shared capital. each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks.

in late , after a controversial visit by likud leader ariel sharon to the temple mount, the second intifada began. it would continue for the next four and a half years. suicide bombings were a recurrent feature of the intifada, causing israeli civilian life to become a battlefield. some commentators contend that the intifada was preplanned by arafat due to the collapse of peace talks. sharon became prime minister in a  special election. during his tenure, sharon carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the gaza strip and also spearheaded the construction of the israeli west bank barrier, ending the intifada. between  and , , israelis, , palestinians and  foreign citizens had been killed.in , a hezbollah artillery assault on israels northern border communities and a crossborder abduction of two israeli soldiers precipitated the monthlong second lebanon war. in , the israeli air force destroyed a nuclear reactor in syria. in , israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between hamas and israel collapsed. the  gaza war lasted three weeks and ended after israel announced a unilateral ceasefire. hamas announced its own ceasefire, with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. despite neither the rocket launchings nor israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped, the fragile ceasefire remained in order. in what israel described as a response to more than a hundred palestinian rocket attacks on southern israeli cities, israel began an operation in the gaza strip in , lasting eight days. israel started another operation in gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by hamas in july . in may , another round of fighting took place in gaza and israel, lasting eleven days.by the s, the increasing regional cooperation between israel and arab league countries have been established, culminating in the signing of the abraham accords. the israeli security situation shifted from the traditional arabisraeli conflict towards the iranisrael proxy conflict and direct confrontation with iran during the syrian civil war. on  october , palestinian militant groups from gaza, led by hamas, launched a series of coordinated attacks on israel, leading to the start of the  israelhamas war. on that day, approximately  israelis, predominantly civilians, were killed in communities near the gaza strip border and during a music festival. over  hostages, including elders, women, and children as young as  months, were kidnapped and taken to the gaza strip.

israel is located in the levant area of the fertile crescent region. the country is at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea, bounded by lebanon to the north, syria to the northeast, jordan and the west bank to the east, and egypt and the gaza strip to the southwest. it lies between latitudes  and  n, and longitudes  and  e.

the sovereign territory of israel  is approximately , square kilometers  in area, of which two percent is water. however israel is so narrow  that the exclusive economic zone in the mediterranean is double the land area of the country. the total area under israeli law, including east jerusalem and the golan heights, is , square kilometers , and the total area under israeli control, including the militarycontrolled and partially palestiniangoverned territory of the west bank, is , square kilometers .despite its small size, israel is home to a variety of geographic features, from the negev desert in the south to the inland fertile jezreel valley, mountain ranges of the galilee, carmel and toward the golan in the north. the israeli coastal plain on the shores of the mediterranean is home to most of the nations population. east of the central highlands lies the jordan rift valley, which forms a small part of the ,kilometer  great rift valley. the jordan river runs along the jordan rift valley, from mount hermon through the hulah valley and the sea of galilee to the dead sea, the lowest point on the surface of the earth. further south is the arabah, ending with the gulf of eilat, part of the red sea. makhtesh, or erosion cirques are unique to the negev and the sinai peninsula, the largest being the makhtesh ramon at  km in length. a report on the environmental status of the mediterranean basin states that israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin. israel contains four terrestrial ecoregions eastern mediterranean conifersclerophyllousbroadleaf forests, southern anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests, arabian desert, and mesopotamian shrub desert. it had a  forest landscape integrity index mean score of ./, ranking it th globally out of  countries.

the jordan rift valley is the result of tectonic movements within the dead sea transform  fault system. the dsf forms the transform boundary between the african plate to the west and the arabian plate to the east. the golan heights and all of jordan are part of the arabian plate, while the galilee, west bank, coastal plain, and negev along with the sinai peninsula are on the african plate. this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region. the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in  and . the deficit in slip that has built up since the  event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw..the most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in  bce, , , and  ce, that is every ca.  years on average. destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every  years. while stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquakesafe, as of  the majority of the buildings in israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as , residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were expected to collapse if exposed to a strong earthquake.

temperatures in israel vary widely, especially during the winter. coastal areas, such as those of tel aviv and haifa, have a typical mediterranean climate with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers. the area of beersheba and the northern negev have a semiarid climate with hot summers, cool winters, and fewer rainy days than the mediterranean climate. the southern negev and the arava areas have a desert climate with very hot, dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain. the highest temperature in the world outside africa and north america as of ,  c , was recorded in  in the tirat zvi kibbutz in the northern jordan river valley.at the other extreme, mountainous regions can be windy and cold, and areas at elevation of  metres  or more  will usually receive at least one snowfall each year. from may to september, rain in israel is rare. with scarce water resources, israel has developed various watersaving technologies, including drip irrigation. israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy, making israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capitapractically every house uses solar panels for water heating.

there are four different phytogeographic regions in israel, due to the countrys location between the temperate and tropical zones, bordering the mediterranean sea in the west and the desert in the east. for this reason, the flora and fauna of israel are extremely diverse. there are , known species of plants found in israel. of these, at least  species are introduced and nonnative. there are  israeli nature reserves.the israeli ministry of environmental protection has reported that climate change will have a decisive impact on all areas of life, including water, public health, agriculture, energy, biodiversity, coastal infrastructure, economics, nature, national security, and geostrategy, and will have the greatest effect on vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, and the chronically ill.

as of  december , israels population was an estimated ,,. in , the civil government recorded . of the population as jews, . of the population as arabs, and . as others . over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from romania, thailand, china, africa, and south america have settled in israel. exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, but estimates run from , to ,. by june , approximately , african migrants had entered israel. about  of israelis live in urban areas.  of palestinian israelis reside in  densely populated towns and villages concentrated in the galilee, triangle and negev regions, with the remaining  in mixed cities and neighbourhoods. data published by the oecd in  estimated the average life expectancy of israelis at . years, making it the thhighest in the world. israeli arab life expectancy lags behind by  to  years, still higher than almost every majority arab or muslim country in the world.

israel was established as a homeland for the jewish people and is often referred to as a jewish state. the countrys law of return grants all jews and those of jewish ancestry the right to israeli citizenship. retention of israels population since  is about even or greater, when compared to other countries with mass immigration. jewish emigration from israel , primarily to the united states and canada, is described by demographers as modest, but is often cited by israeli government ministries as a major threat to israels future.approximately  of israeli jews are born in israel,  are immigrants from europe and the americas, and  are immigrants from asia and africa. jews from europe and the former soviet union and their descendants born in israel, including ashkenazi jews, constitute approximately  of jewish israelis. jews who left or fled arab and muslim countries and their descendants, including both mizrahi and sephardi jews, form most of the rest of the jewish population. jewish intermarriage rates run at over  and recent studies suggest that the percentage of israelis descended from both sephardi and ashkenazi jews increases by . percent every year, with over  of school children now originating from both communities. around  of israelis , ethnically defined as others, are russian descendants of jewish origin or family who are not jewish according to rabbinical law, but were eligible for israeli citizenship under the law of return.the total number of israeli settlers beyond the green line is over , . in , , israelis lived in west bank settlements, including those that predated the establishment of the state of israel and which were reestablished after the sixday war, in cities such as hebron and gush etzion bloc. in addition to the west bank settlements, there were more than , jews living in east jerusalem, and , in the golan heights. approximately , israelis lived in settlements in the gaza strip, known as gush katif, until they were evacuated by the government as part of its  disengagement plan.israeli arabs  comprise . of the population or ,, people. in a  telephone poll,  of arab citizens of israel identified as arab in israel or arab citizen of israel,  identified as palestinian, . as palestinian in israel or palestinian citizen of israel, and . as arab;  of israeli arabs have a positive view of the state. according to sammy smooha, the identity of . of the arabs in   has an israeli component and .  has a palestinian component. however, when these two components were presented as competitors, . of the arabs in  chose exclusive or primary palestinian identity, compared with . who chose exclusive or primary israeli arab identity.

israel has four major metropolitan areas gush dan , jerusalem metropolitan area , haifa metropolitan area , and beersheba metropolitan area .israels largest municipality, in population and area, is jerusalem with , residents in an area of  square kilometres . israeli government statistics on jerusalem include the population and area of east jerusalem, which is widely recognized as part of the palestinian territories under israeli occupation. tel aviv and haifa rank as israels next most populous cities, with populations of , and ,, respectively.

the  city of bnei brak is the most densely populated city in israel and one of the  most densely populated cities in the world.israel has  cities with populations over ,. in all, there are  israeli localities granted municipalities  status by the ministry of the interior, four of which are in the west bank. two more cities are planned kasif, a planned city to be built in the negev, and harish, originally a small town that is being built into a large city since .

a this number includes east jerusalem and west bank areas, which had a total population of , inhabitants in . israeli sovereignty over east jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. 

israels sole official language is hebrew. until , arabic was also one of two official languages of the state of israel; in  it was downgraded to having a special status in the state with its use by state institutions to be set in law. hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken every day by the majority of the population. arabic is spoken by the arab minority, with hebrew taught in arab schools.

as a country of immigrants, many languages can be heard on the streets. due to mass immigration from the former soviet union and ethiopia , russian and amharic are widely spoken. more than one million russianspeaking immigrants arrived in israel from the postsoviet states between  and . french is spoken by around , israelis, mostly originating from france and north africa . english was an official language during the mandate period; it lost this status after the establishment of israel, but retains a role comparable to that of an official language, as may be seen in road signs and official documents. many israelis communicate reasonably well in english, as many television programmes are broadcast in english with subtitles and the language is taught from the early grades in elementary school. in addition, israeli universities offer courses in the english language on various subjects.

israel comprises a major part of the holy land, a region of significant importance to all abrahamic religions, including judaism, christianity, islam, samaritanism, the druze faith and the baháʼí faith.

education is highly valued in the israeli culture and was viewed as a fundamental block of ancient israelites. jewish communities in the levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents was responsible. many international business leaders such as microsoft founder bill gates have praised israel for its high quality of education in helping spur israels economic development and technological boom. in , the country ranked third among oecd members  for the percentage of  yearolds that have attained tertiary education with  compared with the oecd average of . in , the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita .israel has a school life expectancy of  years and a literacy rate of .. the state education law, passed in , established five types of schools state secular, state religious, ultra orthodox, communal settlement schools, and arab schools. the public secular is the largest school group, and is attended by the majority of jewish and nonarab pupils in israel. most arabs send their children to schools where arabic is the language of instruction. education is compulsory in israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen. schooling is divided into three tiers  primary school , middle school , and high school   culminating with bagrut matriculation exams. proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics, the hebrew language, hebrew and general literature, the english language, history, biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a bagrut certificate.israels jewish population maintains a relatively high level of educational attainment where just under half of all israeli jews  hold postsecondary degrees. this figure has remained stable in their already high levels of educational attainment over recent generations. israeli jews  have average of . years of schooling making them one of the most highly educated of all major religious groups in the world. in arab, christian and druze schools, the exam on biblical studies is replaced by an exam on muslim, christian or druze heritage. maariv described the christian arabs sectors as the most successful in education system, since christians fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other religion in israel. israeli children from russianspeaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at highschool level. amongst immigrant children born in the former soviet union, the bagrut pass rate is higher amongst those families from european fsu states at . and lower amongst those from central asian and caucasian fsu states. in , . of all israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate.

israel has a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. a member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime ministerusually this is the chair of the largest party. the prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet.israel is governed by a member parliament, known as the knesset. membership of the knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties, with a . electoral threshold, which in practice has resulted in coalition governments. residents of israeli settlements in the west bank are eligible to vote and after the  election,  of the  members of the knesset  were settlers. parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a noconfidence vote by the knesset can dissolve a government earlier. the first arabled party was established in  and as of , arabled parties hold about  of the parliaments seats.the basic laws of israel function as an uncodified constitution. in its basic laws, israel defines itself as a jewish and democratic state, and as the nationstate of the jewish people. in , the knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws.the president of israel is head of state, with limited and largely ceremonial duties.israel has no official religion, but the definition of the state as jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with judaism, as well as a conflict between state law and religious law. interaction between the political parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the british mandate.on  july , the knesset passed a basic law that characterizes the state of israel as principally a nation state of the jewish people, and hebrew as its official language. the bill ascribes special status to the arabic language. the same bill gives jews a unique right to national selfdetermination, and views the developing of jewish settlement in the country as a national interest, empowering the government to take steps to encourage, advance and implement this interest.

israel has a threetier court system. at the lowest level are magistrate courts, situated in most cities across the country. above them are district courts, serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance; they are situated in five of israels six districts. the third and highest tier is the supreme court, located in jerusalem; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the high court of justice. in the latter role, the supreme court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and noncitizens, to petition against the decisions of state authorities.israels legal system combines three legal traditions english common law, civil law, and jewish law. it is based on the principle of stare decisis  and is an adversarial system, where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court. court cases are decided by professional judges with no role for juries. marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts jewish, muslim, druze, and christian. the election of judges is carried out by a committee of two knesset members, three supreme court justices, two israeli bar members and two ministers . the committees members of the knesset are secretly elected by the knesset, and one of them is traditionally a member of the opposition; the committees supreme court justices are chosen by tradition from all supreme court justices by seniority; the israeli bar members are elected by the bar; and the second minister is appointed by the israeli cabinet. the current justice minister, and the committees chairman, is yariv levin. administration of israels courts  is carried by the administration of courts, situated in jerusalem. both general and labor courts are paperless courts the storage of court files, as well as court decisions, are conducted electronically. israels basic law human dignity and liberty seeks to defend human rights and liberties in israel. as a result of enclave law, large portions of israeli civil law are applied to israeli settlements and israeli residents in the occupied territories.

in , as a result of the sixday war, israel captured and occupied the west bank, including east jerusalem, the gaza strip and the golan heights. israel also captured the sinai peninsula, but returned it to egypt as part of the  egyptisrael peace treaty. between  and , israel occupied part of southern lebanon, in what was known as the security belt. since israels capture of these territories, israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them, except lebanon.

the golan heights and east jerusalem have been fully incorporated into israel under israeli law, but not under international law. israel has applied civilian law to both areas and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship. the un security council has declared the annexation of the golan heights and east jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied. the status of east jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between israeli governments and representatives of the palestinians, as israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital.

the west bank excluding east jerusalem is known in israeli law as the judea and samaria area; the almost , israeli settlers residing in the area are considered part of israels population, have knesset representation, a large part of israels civil and criminal laws applied to them, and their output is considered part of israels economy. the land itself is not considered part of israel under israeli law, as israel has consciously refrained from annexing the territory, without ever relinquishing its legal claim to the land or defining a border with the area. there is no border between israelproper and the west bank for israeli vehicles. israeli political opposition to annexation is primarily due to the perceived demographic threat of incorporating the west banks palestinian population into israel. outside of the israeli settlements, the west bank remains under direct israeli military rule, and palestinians in the area cannot become israeli citizens. the international community maintains that israel does not have sovereignty in the west bank, and considers israels control of the area to be the longest military occupation in modern history. the west bank was occupied and annexed by jordan in , following the  armistice agreements. only britain recognized this annexation and jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the plo. the population are mainly palestinians, including refugees of the  arabisraeli war. from their occupation in  until , the palestinians living in these territories were under israeli military administration. since the israelplo letters of recognition, most of the palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the palestinian authority, and only partial israeli military control, although israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest. in response to increasing attacks during the second intifada, the israeli government started to construct the israeli west bank barrier. when completed, approximately  of the barrier will be constructed on the green line or in israel with  inside the west bank.israels claim of universal suffrage has been questioned due to its blurred territorial boundaries and its simultaneous extension of voting rights to israeli settlers in the occupied territories and denial of voting rights to their palestinian neighbours. the claim has also been challenged due to the alleged ethnocratic nature of the state.

the gaza strip is considered to be a foreign territory under israeli law; however, since israel operates a land, air, and sea blockade of the gaza strip, together with egypt, the international community considers israel to be the occupying power. the gaza strip was occupied by egypt from  to  and then by israel after . in , as part of israels unilateral disengagement plan, israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory, however, it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. the international community, including numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the un, consider gaza to remain occupied. following the  battle of gaza, when hamas assumed power in the gaza strip, israel tightened its control of the gaza crossings along its border, as well as by sea and air, and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian. gaza has a border with egypt, and an agreement between israel, the european union, and the pa governed how border crossing would take place . the application of democracy to its palestinian citizens, and the selective application of israeli democracy in the israelicontrolled palestinian territories, has been criticized.

the international court of justice, principal judicial organ of the un, said, in its  advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the israeli west bank barrier, that the lands captured by israel in the sixday war, including east jerusalem, are occupied territory, and further found that the construction of the wall within the occupied palestinian territory to violate international law. most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of un security council resolution , which emphasizes the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, and calls on israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with arab states, a principle known as land for peace. israel has been criticized for engaging in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories, including the occupation itself, and war crimes against civilians. the allegations include violations of international humanitarian law by the un human rights council, the u.s. state department has called reports of abuses of significant human rights of palestinians credible both within israel and the occupied territories. amnesty international and other ngos have documented mass arbitrary arrests, torture, unlawful killings, systemic abuses and impunity in tandem with a denial of the right to palestinian selfdetermination. in response to such allegations, prime minister netanyahu has defended the countrys security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by criminal killers. some observers, such as israeli officials, scholars, united states ambassador to the un nikki haley and un secretarygenerals ban kimoon and kofi annan, also assert that the un is disproportionately concerned with israeli misconduct.the international community widely regards israeli settlements in the occupied territories illegal under international law. united nations security council resolution , passed on  december  in a  vote by members of the u.n. security council  with the united states abstaining. the resolution states that israels settlement activity constitutes a flagrant violation of international law, has no legal validity and demands that israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the fourth geneva convention. a united nations special rapporteur concluded that settlement program was a war crime under the rome statute, and amnesty international found that the settlement program constitutes an illegal transfer of civilians into occupied territory as well as amounting to pillage, which is prohibited by both the hague conventions and the geneva conventions as well as being a war crime under the rome statute.

israels treatment of the palestinians within the occupied territories has drawn accusations that it is guilty of the crime of apartheid by israeli human rights groups yesh din and btselem, and other international organizations including amnesty international and human rights watch, with the criticism extending to its treatment of palestinians within israel as well. amnestys report was criticised by politicians and representatives from israel, the united states, the united kingdom, the european commission, australia, netherlands and germany, while it was welcomed by palestinians, representatives from other states, and organizations such as the arab league. a  survey of academic experts on the middle east found an increase from  to  of these scholars describing israel as a onestate reality akin to apartheid. in , michael lynk, a canadian law professor appointed by the u.n. human rights council said that the situation met the legal definition of apartheid. subsequent reports from his successor, francesca albanese and from  permanent united nations fact finding mission on the israel palestine conflict chair navi pillay echoed this opinion. the crime of apartheid is a crime against humanity under the rome statute and the international convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid.

israel maintains diplomatic relations with  member states of the united nations, as well as with the holy see, kosovo, the cook islands and niue. it has  diplomatic missions around the world; countries with whom they have no diplomatic relations include most muslim countries. six out of twentytwo nations in the arab league have normalized relations with israel. egypt and jordan signed peace treaties in  and , respectively, but israel remains formally in a state of war with syria, a status that dates back uninterrupted to . it has been in a similarly formal state of war with lebanon since the end of the lebanese civil war in , with the israellebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.

in late , israel normalized relations with four more arab countries the united arab emirates and bahrain in september , sudan in october, and morocco in december. despite the peace treaty between israel and egypt, israel is still widely considered an enemy country among egyptians. iran had diplomatic relations with israel under the pahlavi dynasty but withdrew its recognition of israel during the islamic revolution. israeli citizens may not visit syria, lebanon, iraq, saudi arabia, and yemen  without permission from the ministry of the interior. as a result of the  gaza war, mauritania, qatar, bolivia, and venezuela suspended political and economic ties with israel, though bolivia renewed ties in . china maintains good ties with both israel and the arab world.

france , officially the french republic , is a country located primarily in western europe. it also includes overseas regions and territories in the americas and the atlantic, pacific and indian oceans, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. metropolitan france shares borders with belgium and luxembourg to the north, germany to the north east, switzerland to the east, italy and monaco to the south east, andorra and spain to the south, and a maritime border with the united kingdom to the north west. its metropolitan area extends from the rhine to the atlantic ocean and from the mediterranean sea to the english channel and the north sea; overseas territories include french guiana in south america, saint pierre and miquelon in the north atlantic, the french west indies, and many islands in oceania and the indian ocean. its eighteen integral regions  span a combined area of , km  and have a total population of over  million as of january . france is a unitary semipresidential republic with its capital in paris, the countrys largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include marseille, lyon, toulouse, lille, bordeaux, strasbourg and nice.

metropolitan france was settled during the iron age by celtic tribes known as gauls before rome annexed the area in  bc, leading to a distinct galloroman culture. in the early middle ages, the germanic franks formed the kingdom of francia, which became the heartland of the carolingian empire. the treaty of verdun of  partitioned the empire, with west francia becoming the kingdom of france in . in the high middle ages, france was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the midth to the midth centuries, france was plunged into a dynastic conflict with england known as the hundred years war. in the th century, the french renaissance saw culture flourish and a french colonial empire rise. internally, france was dominated by the conflict with the house of habsburg and the french wars of religion between catholics and huguenots. france was successful in the thirty years war and further increased its influence during the reign of louis xiv.the french revolution of  overthrew the ancien régime and produced the declaration of the rights of man, which expresses the nations ideals to this day. france reached its political and military zenith in the early th century under napoleon bonaparte, subjugating part of continental europe and establishing the first french empire. the french revolutionary and napoleonic wars significantly shaped the course of european history. the collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which france endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the french third republic during the francoprussian war in . subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the belle époque. france was one of the major participants of world war i, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. it was among the allied powers of world war ii, but it surrendered and was occupied by the axis in . following its liberation in , the shortlived fourth republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the algerian war. the current fifth republic was formed in  by charles de gaulle. algeria and most french colonies became independent in the s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with france.

france retains its centurieslong status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. it hosts the fifthlargest number of unesco world heritage sites and is the worlds leading tourist destination, receiving over  million foreign visitors in . france is a developed country with a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and an official nuclearweapon state. france is a founding and leading member of the european union and the eurozone, as well as a key member of the group of seven, north atlantic treaty organization , organisation for economic cooperation and development  and francophonie.

originally applied to the whole frankish empire, the name france comes from the latin francia, or realm of the franks. modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish, while frankreich in german, frankrijk in dutch and frankrike in swedish and norwegian all mean land/realm of the franks.

the name of the franks is related to the english word frank  the latter stems from the old french franc , ultimately from medieval latin francus , a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a late latin borrowing of the reconstructed frankish endonym frank. it has been suggested that the meaning free was adopted because, after the conquest of gaul, only franks were free of taxation, or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.the etymology of frank is uncertain. it is traditionally derived from the protogermanic word frankōn, which translates as javelin or lance , although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the franks, not the other way around.in english, france is pronounced  franss in american english and  frahnss or  franss in british english. the pronunciation with  is mostly confined to accents with the trapbath split such as received pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as cardiff english, in which  is in free variation with .

the oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now france date from approximately . million years ago. neanderthals occupied the region into the upper paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by homo sapiens around , bce. this period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the dordogne and the pyrenees, including at the famous lascaux site, dated to c. , bc. at the end of the last glacial period , the climate became milder; from approximately , bc, this part of western europe entered the neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary.

after strong demographic and agricultural development between the th and rd millennia bc, metallurgy appeared at the end of the rd millennium bc, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron. france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic, including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site .

in  bc, ionian greeks from phocaea founded the colony of massalia , on the shores of the mediterranean sea. this makes it frances oldest city. at the same time, some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern france, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the th and rd century bc.

around  bc, the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to roman italy through the alps, defeated the romans in the battle of the allia, and besieged and ransomed rome. the gallic invasion left rome weakened, and the gauls continued to harass the region until  bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome. but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italy.around  bc, the south of gaul was conquered by the romans, who called this region provincia nostra , which over time evolved into the name provence in french. julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in  bc. gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces. many cities were founded during the galloroman period, including lugdunum , which is considered the capital of the gauls.from the s to the s ad, roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians. nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul. in , emperor constantine i converted to christianity. subsequently, christians who had been persecuted increased rapidly across the entire roman empire. but from the beginning of the th century, the barbarian invasions resumed. teutonic tribes invaded the region from presentday germany, the visigoths settling in the southwest, the burgundians along the rhine river valley, and the franks in the north.

at the end of the antiquity period, ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining galloroman territory, known as the kingdom of syagrius. simultaneously, celtic britons, fleeing the anglosaxon settlement of britain, settled in the western part of armorica. as a result, the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany, celtic culture was revived, and independent petty kingdoms arose in the region.

the first leader to make himself king of all the franks was clovis i, who began his reign in , routing the last forces of the roman governors of the province in . clovis claimed that he would be baptised a christian in the event of his victory against the visigothic kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. clovis regained the southwest from the visigoths, was baptised in  and made himself master of what is now western germany.

clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity, rather than arianism; thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church  by the papacy, and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france .

the franks embraced the christian galloroman culture, and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia . the germanic franks adopted romanic languages, except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged. clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of clovis paris, orléans, soissons, and rheims. the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace . one mayor of the palace, charles martel, defeated an umayyad invasion of gaul at the battle of tours  and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms. his son, pepin the short, seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty. pepins son, charlemagne, reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe.

proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french governments longtime historical association with the catholic church, charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur. charlemagnes son, louis i , kept the empire united; however, this carolingian empire would not survive his death. in , under the treaty of verdun, the empire was divided between louis three sons, with east francia going to louis the german, middle francia to lothair i, and west francia to charles the bald. west francia approximated the area occupied by modern france and was its precursor.during the th and th centuries, continually threatened by viking invasions, france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. thus was established feudalism in france. over time, some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. for example, after the battle of hastings in , william the conqueror added king of england to his titles, becoming both the vassal to  and the equal of  the king of france, creating recurring tensions.

the carolingian dynasty ruled france until , when hugh capet, duke of france and count of paris, was crowned king of the franks. his descendantsthe capetians, the house of valois and the house of bourbonprogressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france, which was fully declared in  by philip ii of france . later kings would expand their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern continental france by the th century, including most of the north, centre and west of france. during this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.

the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades to restore christian access to the holy land. french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the year span of the crusades, in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they came from france. the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant, making french the base of the lingua franca  of the crusader states. french knights also made up the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders. the latter in particular held numerous properties throughout france and by the th century were the principal bankers for the french crown, until philip iv annihilated the order in . the albigensian crusade was launched in  to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modernday france. in the end, the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of france.from the th century, the house of plantagenet, the rulers of the county of anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of maine and touraine, then progressively built an empire that spanned from england to the pyrenees and covering half of modern france. tensions between the kingdom of france and the plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until philip ii of france conquered, between  and , most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving england and aquitaine to the plantagenets.

charles iv the fair died without an heir in . under salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line. accordingly, the crown passed to philip of valois, rather than through the female line to edward of plantagenet, who would soon become edward iii of england. during the reign of philip of valois, the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. however philips seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england in , and england and france entered the offandon hundred years war. the boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside france by the english kings remained extensive for decades. with charismatic leaders, such as joan of arc and la hire, strong french counterattacks won back most english continental territories. like the rest of europe, france was struck by the black death, from which half of the  million population of france died.

the french renaissance saw spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language, which would become the official language of france and the language of europes aristocracy. it also saw a long set of wars, known as the italian wars, between france and the house of habsburg. french explorers such as jacques cartier and samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france, paving the way for the expansion of the french colonial empire. the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st. bartholomews day massacre of . the wars of religion were ended by henry ivs edict of nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots. spanish troops, the terror of western europe, assisted the catholic side from  to  and invaded northern france in ; after some skirmishing in the s and s, spain and france returned to allout war between  and . the war cost france , casualties.under louis xiii, cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the s. he systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence . by the end of the s, richelieu established the royal monopoly of force as the doctrine.from the th to the th century, france was responsible for  of the transatlantic slave trade, second only to great britain during the th century. while the state began condoning the practice with letters patent in the s, louis xiii only formalized this authorization more generally in  in the last year of his reign. by the midth century, nantes had become the principal french slavetrading port.

during louis xivs minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin, a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france. this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in france. the monarchy reached its peak during the th century and the reign of louis xiv. by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. remembered for numerous wars, the socalled sun king made france the leading european power. france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics, economy, and culture. french became the mostused language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the th century. during his reign, france took colonial control of many overseas territories in the americas, africa and asia. in , louis xiv revoked the edict of nantes, forcing thousands of huguenots into exile and published the code noir providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling jewish people from the french colonies.under the wars of louis xv , france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war . its european territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as lorraine  and corsica . an unpopular king, louis xvs weak rule, his illadvised financial, political and military decisionsas well as the decadence of his courtdiscredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the french revolution  years after his death.louis xvi  actively supported the americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from great britain. france gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcya factor that contributed to the french revolution. some of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the naming of oxygen  and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers , were achieved by french scientists. french explorers, such as bougainville and lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. the enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the french revolution.

facing financial troubles, louis xvi summoned the estatesgeneral  in may  to propose solutions to his government. as it came to an impasse, the representatives of the third estate formed a national assembly, signalling the outbreak of the french revolution. fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly, insurgents stormed the bastille on  july , a date which would become frances national day.

in early august , the national constituent assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , france established fundamental rights for men. the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression. freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. in november , the assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country. in july , a civil constitution of the clergy reorganised the french catholic church, cancelling the authority of the church to levy taxes, et cetera. this fueled much discontent in parts of france, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. while louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to varennes in june  seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.

in the august  declaration of pillnitz, the emperor of austria and the king of prussia threatened to restore the french monarch by force. in september , the national constituent assembly forced louis xvi to accept the french constitution of , thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. in the newly established legislative assembly , enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the girondins, who favoured war with austria and prussia, and a group later called montagnards or jacobins who opposed such a war. a majority in the assembly in  however saw a war with austria and prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that such a war could be won and so declared war on austria on  april .

on  august , an angry crowd threatened the palace of louis xvi, who took refuge in the legislative assembly. a prussian army invaded france later in august . in early september, parisians, infuriated by the prussian army capturing verdun and counterrevolutionary uprisings in the west of france, murdered between , and , prisoners by raiding the parisian prisons. the assembly and the paris city council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed. the national convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage, on  september  succeeded the legislative assembly and on  september abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the french first republic. louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in january . france had declared war on great britain and the dutch republic in november  and did the same on spain in march ; in the spring of , austria and prussia invaded france; in march, france created a sister republic in the republic of mainz and kept it under control.

also in march , a counterrevolution in vendée began, evoked by both the civil constitution of the clergy of  and the nationwide army conscription in early ; elsewhere in france rebellion was brewing too. a factionalist feud in the national convention, smouldering ever since october , came to a climax on  june  with the group of the girondins being forced to resign and leave the convention. by july the counterrevolution had spread to brittany, normandy, bordeaux, marseilles, toulon, and lyon. between october and december , paris convention government took brutal measures to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until  with a toll of possibly , lives. by the end of , the allies had been driven from france. 

political disagreements and enmity in the national convention reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. meanwhile, frances external wars in  were prospering, for example in belgium. in , the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of  religion and fair distribution of food. until , politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system , busied themselves with dissuading the people from catholicism and royalism.

general napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in  becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire . as a continuation of the french revolutionary wars, changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleons empire. his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jenaauerstadt and austerlitz. members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man. in june  napoleon attacked russia, reaching moscow. thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, russian attacks, and finally winter. after the catastrophic russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule, napoleon was defeated. about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars. after his brief return from exile, napoleon was finally defeated in  at the battle of waterloo, and the bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations.

the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of , which established the constitutional july monarchy. in that year, french troops began the conquest of algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in africa since napoleons abortive invasion of egypt in . in , general unrest led to the february revolution and the end of the july monarchy. the abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the french revolution, was reenacted in . in , the president of the french republic, louisnapoléon bonaparte, napoleon is nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the second empire, as napoleon iii. he multiplied french interventions abroad, especially in crimea, mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice, then part of the kingdom of sardinia. napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the francoprussian war of , and his regime was replaced by the third republic. by , the french conquest of algeria was complete, with approximately , algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.

france had colonial possessions, in various forms since the beginning of the th century, but in the th and th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the secondlargest in the world behind the british empire. including metropolitan france, the total area of land under french sovereignty reached almost  million square kilometres in the s and s, . of the worlds land. known as the belle époque, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. in , state secularism was officially established.

france was invaded by germany and defended by great britain to start world war i in august . a rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. france and the allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost. world war i left . million french soldiers dead,  of its population. between  and  of soldiers conscripted from  to  were killed. the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government .

in , france was invaded and quickly defeated by nazi germany. france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north, an italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of france, which consisted of the southern french metropolitan territory  and the french empire ; the vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. free france, the governmentinexile led by charles de gaulle, was set up in london.from  to , about , french citizens, including around , jews, were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and occupied poland. in september , corsica was the first french metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the axis powers. on  june , the allies invaded normandy, and in august they invaded provence. over the following year, the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious, and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic . this interim government, established by de gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office. it also made several important reforms .

the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic , which saw spectacular economic growth . france was one of the founding members of nato. france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in  at the climactic battle of dien bien phu. only months later, france faced another anticolonialist conflict in algeria, then treated as an integral part of france and home to over one million european settlers . during the conflict, the french systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control of algeria. this conflict wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in france.during the may  crisis, the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic, which included a strengthened presidency. in the latter role, de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the algerian war. the war was concluded with the évian accords in  which led to algerian independence. algerian independence came at a high price it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over  million internally displaced algerians. around one million piednoirs and harkis fled from algeria to france upon independence. a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories.

in the context of the cold war, de gaulle pursued a policy of national independence towards the western and eastern blocs. to this end, he withdrew from natos militaryintegrated command , launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power. he restored cordial francogerman relations to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence. however, he opposed any development of a supranational europe, favouring a europe of sovereign nations. in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of , the revolt of may  had an enormous social impact. it was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal  shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal . although the revolt was a political failure  it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle, who resigned shortly after.in the postgaullist era, france remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. in the late th and early st centuries, france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union, notably by signing the maastricht treaty  in , establishing the eurozone in  and signing the treaty of lisbon in . france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most natosponsored wars.

since the th century, france has received many immigrants. these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. during the s france faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants  to permanently settle in france with their families and acquire french citizenship. it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims  living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates. simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms. they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.since the  paris métro and rer bombings, france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations, notably the charlie hebdo attack in january  which provoked the largest public rallies in french history, gathering . million people, the november  paris attacks which resulted in  deaths, the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in , as well as the  nice truck attack, which caused  deaths during bastille day celebrations. opération chammal, frances military efforts to contain isis, killed over , isis troops between  and .

the vast majority of frances territory and population is situated in western europe and is called metropolitan france, to distinguish it from the countrys various overseas polities. it is bordered by the north sea in the north, the english channel in the northwest, the atlantic ocean in the west and the mediterranean sea in the southeast. its land borders consist of belgium and luxembourg in the northeast, germany and switzerland in the east, italy and monaco in the southeast, and andorra and spain in the south and southwest. except for the northeast, most of frances land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features to the south and southeast, the pyrenees and the alps and the jura, respectively, and to the east, the rhine river. due to its shape, france is often referred to as lhexagone . metropolitan france includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is corsica. metropolitan france is situated mostly between latitudes  and  n, and longitudes  w and  e, on the western edge of europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. its continental part covers about  km from north to south and from east to west.

metropolitan france covers , square kilometres , the largest among european union members. frances total land area, with its overseas departments and territories , is , km , . of the total land area on earth. france possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the alps in the southeast, the massif central in the southcentral and pyrenees in the southwest.

due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, france possesses the secondlargest exclusive economic zone  in the world, covering ,, km , just behind the eez of the united states, which covers ,, km , but ahead of the eez of australia, which covers ,, km . its eez covers approximately  of the total surface of all the eezs of the world.

metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era, during which the armorican massif, the massif central, the morvan, the vosges and ardennes ranges and the island of corsica were formed. these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of beauce and brie. various routes of natural passage, such as the rhône valley, allow easy communication. the alpine, pyrenean and jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. at ,. metres  above sea level, mont blanc, located in the alps on the french and italian border, is the highest point in western europe. although  of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate.

the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges along the french riviera, coastal cliffs such as the côte dalbâtre, and wide sandy plains in the languedoc. corsica lies off the mediterranean coast. france has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers seine, the loire, the garonne, the rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over  of the metropolitan territory. the rhône divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue. the garonne meets the dordogne just after bordeaux, forming the gironde estuary, the largest estuary in western europe which after approximately  kilometres  empties into the atlantic ocean. other water courses drain towards the meuse and rhine along the northeastern borders. france has  million square kilometres  of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which  are overseas.

france was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in . although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, france is ranked only th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as canada or australia. this is due to the countrys heavy investment in nuclear power following the  oil crisis, which now accounts for  per cent of its electricity production and results in less pollution. according to the  environmental performance index conducted by yale and columbia, france was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world .like all european union state members, france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least  of  levels by , compared to the united states plan to reduce emissions by  of  levels. as of , french carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of china. the country was set to impose a carbon tax in  at  euros per tonne of carbon emitted, which would have raised  billion euros of revenue annually. however, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening french businesses.forests account for  per cent of frances land areathe fourthhighest proportion in europerepresenting an increase of  per cent since . french forests are some of the most diverse in europe, comprising more than  species of trees. france had a  forest landscape integrity index mean score of ./, ranking it rd globally out of  countries. there are nine national parks and  natural parks in france, with the government planning to convert  of its exclusive economic zone into a marine protected area by . a regional nature park  is a public establishment in france between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area. a pnr sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each parks unique landscape and heritage. the parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences. as of  there are  pnrs in france.

the french republic is divided into  regions , five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity  new caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the minister of overseas france  clipperton.

since , france is divided into  administrative regions  regions in metropolitan france , and five overseas. the regions are further subdivided into  departments, which are numbered mainly alphabetically. the department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. among the  french departments, five  are in overseas regions  that are simultaneously overseas departments , enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the european union.

the  departments are subdivided into  arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into , cantons. these cantons are then divided into , communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. three communesparis, lyon and marseilleare subdivided into  municipal arrondissements.

since the middle ages, france has been a contributor to scientific and technological achievement. in the early th century, the frenchborn pope sylvester ii reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere and introduced arabic numerals and clocks to much of europe. the university of paris, founded in the midth century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the western world. in the th century, mathematician and philosopher rené descartes pioneered rationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, while blaise pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics; both were key figures of the scientific revolution, which blossomed in europe during this period. the french academy of sciences, founded in the midth century by louis xiv to encourage and protect french scientific research, was one of the earliest national scientific institutions in history.

the age of enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist buffon, one of the first naturalists to recognise ecological succession, and chemist lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion. diderot and dalembert published the encyclopédie, which aimed to give the public access to useful knowledge that could be applied to everyday life. the industrial revolution of the th century saw spectacular scientific developments in france, with augustin fresnel founding modern optics, sadi carnot laying the foundations of thermodynamics, and louis pasteur pioneering microbiology. other eminent french scientists of the period have their names inscribed on the eiffel tower. 

famous french scientists of the th century include the mathematician and physicist henri poincaré; physicists henri becquerel, pierre and marie curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity; physicist paul langevin; and virologist luc montagnier, codiscoverer of hiv aids. hand transplantation was developed in lyon in  by an international team that included jeanmichel dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant. telesurgery was first performed by french surgeons led by jacques marescaux on  september  across the atlantic ocean. a face transplant was first done on  november  by bernard devauchelle. france ranked th in the  global innovation index, compared to th in .

with an estimated january  population of ,, people, france is the th most populous country in the world, the thirdmost populous in europe , and the second most populous in the european union .

france is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth by birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the european union in . between  and , france saw the secondhighest overall increase in population in the eu and was one of only four eu countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth. this was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in  and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of . in  to . in .

as of january , the fertility rate declined slightly to . children per woman, below the replacement rate of ., and considerably below the high of . in . frances fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the eu. however, like many developed nations, the french population is aging; the average age is . years, while about a fifth of french people are  or over. the life expectancy at birth is . years, the th highest in the world.

from  to , population growth averaged . per cent per year; since , annual growth has been between . and . per cent annually. immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in ,  per cent of newborns in metropolitan france had at least one foreignborn parent and another  per cent had at least one parent born outside europe .

historically, french people were mainly of celticgallic origin, with a significant admixture of italic  and germanic  groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement. through the course of the middle ages, france incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by breton elements in the west, aquitanian in the southwest, scandinavian in the northwest, alemannic in the northeast, and ligurian in the southeast.

largescale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the french revolution, and further codified in the french constitution of , the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. in , the institut montaigne estimated that within metropolitan france,  million people were white ,  million were northwest african ,  million were black , and  million were asian .a  poll conducted jointly by the institut national détudes démographiques and the french national institute of statistics estimated that the largest ancestry groups were italian , followed by northwest african , subsaharan african , armenian , and turkish . there are also sizeable minorities of other european ethnic groups, namely spanish, portuguese, polish, and greek. france has a significant gitan  population, numbering between , and ,; many foreign roma are expelled back to bulgaria and romania frequently.

it is currently estimated that  of the french population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early th century; between  and  alone, about . million net immigrants came to france. the next largest wave came in the s when around . million pieds noirs returned to france following the independence of its northwest african possessions, algeria and morocco. they were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from north and west africa, as well as numerous european immigrants from spain and portugal.

in , napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession. nevertheless, jules ferry is considered the father of the french modern school, leading reforms in the late th century that established free, secular and compulsory education .french education is centralised and divided into three stages primary, secondary, and higher education. the programme for international student assessment, coordinated by the oecd, ranked frances education as near the oecd average in . france was one of the pisaparticipating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers. schoolchildren in france reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other oecd countries.higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective grandes écoles, such as sciences po paris for political studies, hec paris for economics, polytechnique, the école des hautes études en sciences sociales for social studies and the école nationale supérieure des mines de paris that produce highprofile engineers, or the école nationale dadministration for careers in the grands corps of the state. the grandes écoles have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of frances highranking civil servants, ceos and politicians.

the origins of french art were very much influenced by flemish art and by italian art at the time of the renaissance. jean fouquet, the most famous medieval french painter, is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance firsthand. the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino, who both worked in france. two of the most famous french artists of the time of the baroque era, nicolas poussin and claude lorrain, lived in italy. 

french artists developed the rococo style in the th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the courtendorsed artists antoine watteau, françois boucher and jeanhonoré fragonard being the most representative in the country. the french revolution brought great changes, as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacqueslouis david and the highly influential académie des beauxarts defined the style known as academism.

in the second part of the th century, frances influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism. the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro, édouard manet, edgar degas, claude monet and auguste renoir. the second generation of impressioniststyle painters, paul cézanne, paul gauguin, toulouselautrec and georges seurat, were also at the avantgarde of artistic evolutions, as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse, andré derain and maurice de vlaminck.at the beginning of the th century, cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso, living in paris. other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris, such as vincent van gogh, marc chagall, amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky.

there are many art museums in france, the most famous of which being the stateowned musée du louvre, which collects artwork from the th century and earlier. the musée dorsay was inaugurated in  in the old railway station gare dorsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather french paintings from the second part of the th century . it was voted the best museum in the world in . modern works are presented in the musée national dart moderne, which moved in  to the centre georges pompidou. these three stateowned museums are visited by close to  million people a year.

during the middle ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. some french castles that survived are chinon, château dangers, the massive château de vincennes and the socalled cathar castles. during this era, france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe.

gothic architecture, originally named opus francigenum meaning french work, was born in îledefrance and was the first french style of architecture to be imitated throughout europe. northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the saint denis basilica ; other important french gothic cathedrals are notredame de chartres and notredame damiens. the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notredame de reims.the final victory in the hundred years war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture. it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court; many residential palaces were built in the loire valley, from  as a first reference the château de montsoreau. examples of such residential castles include the château de chambord, the château de chenonceau, or the château damboise.

following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages, baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style. however, in france, baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one. in the secular domain, the palace of versailles has many baroque features. jules hardouin mansart, who designed the extensions to versailles, was one of the most influential french architects of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at les invalides. some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as place stanislas in nancy. on the military architectural side, vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over europe, the americas, russia and turkey.after the revolution, the republicans favoured neoclassicism although it was introduced in france before the revolution with such buildings as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse. built during the first french empire, the arc de triomphe and sainte mariemadeleine represent the best example of empirestyle architecture. under napoleon iii, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neobaroque palais garnier were built. the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, haussmanns renovation of paris. the architecture associated with this era is named second empire in english, the term being taken from the second french empire. at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france; the associated architect was eugène violletleduc. in the late th century, gustave eiffel designed many bridges, such as the garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the eiffel tower.

in the th century, frenchswiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france. more recently, french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. for instance, in paris, since , new buildings had to be under  metres . frances largest financial district is la défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct. some famous modern french architects include jean nouvel, dominique perrault, christian de portzamparc and paul andreu.

the earliest french literature dates from the middle ages when what is now known as modern france did not have a single, uniform language. there were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. some authors of french medieval texts, such as tristan and iseult and lancelotgrail are unknown. three famous medieval authors are chrétien de troyes, christine de pizan , and duke william ix of aquitaine . much medieval french poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the carolingian cycle, such as the song of roland and the various chansons de geste. the roman de renart, written in  by perrout de saint cloude, tells the story of the medieval character reynard  and is another example of early french writing. an important thcentury writer was françois rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. rabelais was also in regular communication with marguerite de navarre, author of the heptameron. another thcentury author was michel de montaigne, whose most famous work, essais, started a literary genre.french literature and poetry flourished during the th and th centuries. denis diderots bestknown works are jacques the fatalist and rameaus nephew. he is best known, however, as the main editor of the encyclopédie, whose aim was, to sum up all the knowledge of his century  and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. during that same century, charles perrault was a prolific writer of childrens fairy tales including puss in boots, cinderella, sleeping beauty and bluebeard. at the start of the th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in french literature, with poets such as charles baudelaire, paul verlaine and stéphane mallarmé.the th century saw the writings of many renowned french authors. victor hugo is sometimes seen as the greatest french writer of all time for excelling in all literary genres. the preface of his play cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the romantic movement. les contemplations and la légende des siècles are considered poetic masterpieces, hugos verse has been compared to that of shakespeare, dante and homer. his novel les misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written and the hunchback of notre dame has remained immensely popular. other major authors of that century include alexandre dumas , jules verne , émile zola , honoré de balzac , guy de maupassant, théophile gautier and stendhal , whose works are among the most well known in france and the world.

in the early th century france was a haven for literary freedom. works banned for obscenity in the us, the uk and other anglophone nations were published in france decades before they were available in the respective authors home countries. the french were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare. important writers of the th century include marcel proust, louisferdinand céline, jean cocteau, albert camus, and jeanpaul sartre. antoine de saint exupéry wrote the little prince, which has remained popular for decades and is one of the best selling books in history.medieval philosophy was dominated by scholasticism until the emergence of humanism in the renaissance. modern philosophy began in france in the th century with the philosophy of rené descartes, blaise pascal and nicolas malebranche. descartes was the first western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors. france in the th century saw major philipshocial contributions from voltaire who came to embody the enlightenment and jeanjacques rousseau whose work highly influenced the french revolution. french philosophers made major contributions to the field in the th century including the existentialist works of simone de beauvoir, camus, and sartre. other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works of simone weil, contributions to structuralism including from claude lévistrauss and the poststructuralist works by michel foucault.

france has a long and varied musical history. it experienced a golden age in the th century thanks to louis xiv, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. the most renowned composers of this period include marcantoine charpentier, françois couperin, michelrichard delalande, jeanbaptiste lully and marin marais, all of them composers at the court. after the death of the roi soleil, french musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of jeanphilippe rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned french composers. rameau became the dominant composer of french opera and the leading french composer of the harpsichord.érik satie was a key member of the earlythcentury parisian avantgarde, best known for his gymnopédies. francis poulencs bestknown works are his piano suite trois mouvements perpétuels , the ballet les biches , the concert champêtre  for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera dialogues des carmélites  and the gloria  for soprano, choir and orchestra. maurice ravel and claude debussy are the most prominent figures associated with impressionist music. debussy was among the most influential composers of the late th and early th centuries, and his use of nontraditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. debussys music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. the two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. ravels piano compositions, such as jeux deau, miroirs, le tombeau de couperin and gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. his mastery of orchestration is evident in the rapsodie espagnole, daphnis et chloé, his arrangement of modest mussorgskys pictures at an exhibition and his orchestral work boléro . more recently, in the middle of the th century, maurice ohana, pierre schaeffer and pierre boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.french music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the th century. although englishspeaking creations achieved popularity in the country, french pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. among the most important french artists of the century are édith piaf, georges brassens, léo ferré, charles aznavour and serge gainsbourg. although there are very few rock bands in france compared to englishspeaking countries, bands such as noir désir, mano negra, niagara, les rita mitsouko and more recently superbus, phoenix and gojira, or shaka ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.

france has historical and strong links with cinema, with two frenchmen, auguste and louis lumière  credited with creating cinema in . the worlds first female filmmaker, alice guyblaché, was also from france. several important cinematic movements, including the late s and s nouvelle vague, began in the country. it is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the government of france. france remains a leader in filmmaking, as of  producing more films than any other european country. the nation also hosts the cannes festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, france has also been a gathering spot for artists from across europe and the world. for this reason, french cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. directors from nations such as poland , argentina , russia , austria  and georgia  are prominent in the ranks of french cinema. conversely, french directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as luc besson, jacques tourneur or francis veber in the united states. although the french film market is dominated by hollywood, france is the only nation in the world where american films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at , compared with  in germany and  in japan. french films account for  of the total film revenues of france, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the united states, compared to  in spain and  in the uk. in  france was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the united states.as part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products, france succeeded in convincing all eu members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the wto in . moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by unesco in  the principle of cultural exception won an overwhelming victory with  countries voting for it and only  countries, the united states and israel, voting against it.

pablo emilio escobar gaviria  was a colombian drug lord, narcoterrorist, and politician, who was the founder and sole leader of the medellín cartel. dubbed the king of cocaine, escobar was the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of us billion by the time of his deathequivalent to  billion as of while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the united states in the s and early s.born in rionegro and raised in medellín, escobar studied briefly at universidad autónoma latinoamericana of medellín, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. in the early s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.

in , escobar founded the medellín cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes from peru, bolivia and ecuador, through colombia and eventually into the united states. escobars infiltration into the u.s. created exponential demand for cocaine and by the s it was estimated escobar led monthly shipments of  to  tons of cocaine into the country from colombia. as a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the world, but constantly battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians, making colombia the murder capital of the world.in the  colombian parliamentary election, escobar was elected as an alternate member of the chamber of representatives as part of the liberal party. through this, he was responsible for community projects such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. however, escobars political ambitions were thwarted by the colombian and u.s. governments, who routinely pushed for his arrest, with escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the avianca flight  and das building bombings in retaliation.

in , escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with colombian president césar gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, selfbuilt prison, la catedral. in , escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nationwide manhunt. as a result, the medellín cartel crumbled, and in , escobar was killed in his hometown by colombian national police, a day after his th birthday.escobars legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was seen as a robin hoodlike figure for many in colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor. his killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over , people. additionally, his private estate, hacienda nápoles, has been transformed into a theme park. his life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized widely in film, television, and in music.

pablo emilio escobar gaviria was born on  december  in rionegro, antioquia department. he was the third of seven children and grew up in poverty, in the neighboring city of medellin. his father was a small farmer and his mother was a teacher. escobar left high school in  just before his th birthday, before returning two years later with his cousin gustavo gaviria. at this time, the hard life on the streets of medellin had polished them into gangster bullies in the eyes of teachers. the two dropped out of school after more than a year, but escobar, who did not give up, briefly became autonomous in latin america by forging high school diplomas. he then studied in college with the goal of becoming a criminal lawyer, a politician, and eventually the president, but had to give up because of lack of money.

escobar started his criminal career with his gang by stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them. after dropping out of school, escobar began to join gangs to steal cars. escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when escobar had received the ransom. his most famous kidnapping victim was businessman diego echavarria, who was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of , escobar received a , ransom from the echavarria family; his gang became wellknown for this kidnapping.

escobar had been involved in organized crime for a decade when the cocaine trade began to spread in colombia in the mids. escobars meteoric rise caught the attention of the colombian security service , who arrested him in may  on his return from drug trafficking in ecuador. das agents found  kg of cocaine in the spare tire of escobars car. escobar managed to change the first judge in the lawsuit and bribed the second judge, so he was released along with other prisoners. the following year, the agent who arrested escobar was assassinated. escobar continued to bribe and intimidate colombian law enforcement agencies, in the same fashion. his carrotandstick strategy of bribing public officials and political candidates in colombia, in addition to sending hitmen to murder the ones who rejected his bribes, came to be known as silver or lead, meaning money or death. the medellín cartel and the cali cartel both managed to bribe colombian politicians, and campaigned for both the conservative and liberal parties. hence, escobar and many other colombian drug lords were pulling strings in every level of the colombian government, because many of the political candidates whom they backed financially were eventually elected. although the medellín cartel was only established in the early s, it expanded after escobar met several drug lords on a farm in april , and by the end of  they had transported some , kilograms of cocaine to the united states.

soon, the demand for cocaine greatly increased in the united states, which led to escobar organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in south florida, california, puerto rico, and other parts of the country. he and cartel cofounder carlos lehder worked together to develop a new transshipment point in the bahamas, an island called normans cay about  km  southeast of the florida coast. according to his brother, escobar did not purchase normans cay; it was instead a sole venture of lehders. escobar and robert vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a kilometre  airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine. from  to , this was used as a central smuggling route for the medellín cartel. with the enormous profits generated by this route, escobar was soon able to purchase  square kilometres  of land in antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the hacienda nápoles. the luxury house he created contained a zoo, a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other amenities for his family and the cartel.

escobar was also involved in philanthropy in colombia and paid handsomely for the staff of his cocaine lab. escobar spent millions developing some of medellíns poorest neighborhoods. he built housing complexes, parks, football stadiums, hospitals, schools, and churches. escobar also entered politics in the s and participated in and supported the formation of the liberal party of colombia. in , he successfully entered the colombian congress. although only an alternate, he was automatically granted parliamentary immunity and the right to a diplomatic passport under colombian law. at the same time, escobar was gradually becoming a public figure, and because of his charitable work, he was known as robin hood paisa. he alleged once in an interview that his fortune came from a bicycle rental company he founded when he was  years old.

in congress, the new minister of justice, rodrigo larabonilla, had become escobars opponent, accusing escobar of criminal activity from the very first day of congress. escobars arrest in  was investigated by larabonillas subordinates. a few months later, liberal leader luis carlos galán expelled escobar from the party. although escobar fought back, he announced his retirement from politics in january . three months later, larabonilla was murdered.the colombian judiciary had been a target of escobar throughout the mids. while bribing and murdering several judges, in the fall of , the wanted escobar requested the colombian government to allow his conditional surrender without extradition to the united states. the proposal was initially answered in the negative, and escobar subsequently founded and implicitly supported the los extraditable organization, which aims to fight extradition policy. the los extraditable organization was subsequently accused of participating in an effort to prevent the colombian supreme court from studying the constitutionality of colombias extradition treaty with the united states. in support of the  november , farleft guerrilla movement that attacked the colombian judiciary building and killed half of the justices of the supreme court. in late , colombias supreme court declared the previous extradition treaty illegal due to being signed by a presidential delegation, not the president. escobars victory over the judiciary was shortlived, with new president virgilio barco vargas having quickly renewed his agreement with the united states.escobar still held a grudge against luis carlos galán for kicking him out of politics, so galán was assassinated on  august  at escobars orders. escobar then planted a bomb on avianca flight  in an attempt to assassinate galáns successor, césar gaviria trujillo, who missed the plane and survived. all  people were killed in the blast. because two americans were also killed in the bombing, the u.s. government began to intervene directly.

after the assassination of luis carlos galán, the administration of césar gaviria moved against escobar and the drug cartels. eventually, the government negotiated with escobar and convinced him to surrender and cease all criminal activity in exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. declaring an end to a series of previous violent acts meant to pressure authorities and public opinion, escobar surrendered to colombian authorities in . before he gave himself up, the extradition of colombian citizens to the united states had been prohibited by the newly approved colombian constitution of . this act was controversial, as it was suspected that escobar and other drug lords had influenced members of the constituent assembly in passing the law. escobar was confined in what became his own luxurious private prison, la catedral, which featured a football pitch, a giant dollhouse, a bar, a jacuzzi, and a waterfall. accounts of escobars continued criminal activities while in prison began to surface in the media, which prompted the government to attempt to move him to a more conventional jail on  july . escobars influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and make a successful escape, spending the remainder of his life evading the police.

escobar faced threats from the colombian police, the u.s. government and his rival, the cali cartel. on  december , escobar was found in a house in a middleclass residential area of medellin by colombian special forces using technology provided by the united states. police tried to arrest escobar, but the situation quickly escalated to an exchange of gun fire. escobar was shot and killed while trying to escape from the roof. he was hit by bullets in the torso and feet, and a bullet which struck him in the head, killing him. this sparked debate about whether he killed himself or whether he was shot dead.

soon after escobars death and the subsequent fragmentation of the medellín cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival cali cartel until the mids when its leaders were either killed or captured by the colombian government. the robin hood image that escobar had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in medellín. many there, especially many of the citys poor whom escobar had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over , people attended his funeral. some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help. escobar was buried at the monte sacro cemetery.

on  july , virginia vallejo, a television anchorwoman romantically involved with escobar from  to , offered attorney general mario iguarán her testimony in the trial against former senator alberto santofimio, who was accused of conspiracy in the  assassination of presidential candidate luis carlos galán. iguarán acknowledged that, although vallejo had contacted his office on  july, the judge had decided to close the trial on  july, several weeks before the prospective closing date. the action was seen as too late.on  july , vallejo was taken to the united states on a special flight of the drug enforcement administration , for safety and security reasons due to her cooperation in highprofile criminal cases. on  july, a video in which vallejo had accused santofimio of instigating escobar to eliminate presidential candidate galán was aired by rcn television of colombia. the video was seen by  million people, and was instrumental for the reopened case of galáns assassination. on  august  santofimio was sentenced to  years in prison for his role in the crime.
