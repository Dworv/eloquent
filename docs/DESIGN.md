## Brainstorming

Problem statement: Qwerty is a very unoptimized keyboard layout. By creating a better layout for myself and putting it onto a real keyboard, I could become a much faster typist. I plan to do a number of different tests before running simulating the speed of keyboard layouts, including testing speeds of different keypresses for different people to create a genereal picture of how fast the different keys are pressed.

I am current working on a method to test how fast different fingers are. My plan is to use the information I have about where different fingers belong on the keyboard and test how fast they can move between those keys. I will use this information later to create a realistic simulation of how fast a keyboard layout is for typing a specific text. Here is an example of what a test would look like.

I will continue to work on this test until I have some strong data to help me create the ultimate keyboard layout.
