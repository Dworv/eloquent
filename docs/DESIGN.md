| 2023/10/18  | Problem statement: Qwerty is a very unoptimized keyboard layout. By creating a better layout for myself and putting it onto a real keyboard, I could become a much faster typist. I plan to do a number of different tests before running simulating the speed of keyboard layouts, including testing speeds of different keypresses for different people to create a genereal picture of how fast the different keys are pressed. |
