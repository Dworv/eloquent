Using human experimentation, the top 100 wikipedia articles and some simulated annealing, I was able to generate this very cool looking keyboard layout. According to my tests, this should be 26% faster than qwerty.

## Usage
The rust sections can be run from the root working directory by running `cargo run --bin <SUBPROJECT>`. 
The analysis notebook can be run with `cd analysis; jupyter nbconvert --execute analyzer.ipynb`.
